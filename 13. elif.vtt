00:00.390 --> 00:03.480
Come back in this video we are going to check out Ellis.

00:03.530 --> 00:09.540
And Ellis is the short form for else if and if you know any other programming languages you already

00:09.540 --> 00:11.930
know what else does and what elevates us.

00:12.090 --> 00:19.650
But if not then I'd be very careful because we're going to use a different approach in using IF statements.

00:19.650 --> 00:22.380
So let's go ahead and check out this example.

00:22.380 --> 00:28.710
So we have this example where we have the currency which is for example euros.

00:29.100 --> 00:34.200
And then I want to check if the currency is double equal.

00:34.240 --> 00:37.230
I'm comparing is equal to dollar.

00:37.380 --> 00:42.650
Then I would like to print something like US dollar.

00:43.590 --> 00:46.770
So for now if I execute that as you can see nothing happens.

00:46.770 --> 00:54.570
But what if I want to check other currencies as well not just the euro one not just a dollar one I want

00:54.570 --> 00:55.730
to check out others.

00:56.070 --> 00:58.090
So I'm going to have an else here.

00:58.350 --> 01:04.470
So if the currency is not a dollar then I can go ahead and have an else and in here I'm going to check

01:04.470 --> 01:10.560
again if currency is going to be yen.

01:10.650 --> 01:14.150
And I have yen prepared here.

01:14.370 --> 01:20.040
I don't know what combination on the keyboard would be to get yen but I have it prepared here so if

01:20.040 --> 01:26.790
currency is yen then please write something like Japanese yen

01:29.550 --> 01:34.440
then I need to check another else if I want to check another currency.

01:34.440 --> 01:38.540
So let's say I want to check if the currency is for example euros.

01:38.850 --> 01:43.930
Then please go ahead and write something like print euro.

01:44.770 --> 01:48.060
Well then there could be another currency that I want to check.

01:48.060 --> 01:58.170
So let's say I wanted to check if the currency is a tie but and again I'm going to use a prepared sign

01:58.170 --> 02:07.020
here bought and then I'm going to print something like tie bought and as you can see if I execute that

02:07.050 --> 02:08.600
it executes euro.

02:08.970 --> 02:11.900
But there is something to consider here.

02:12.120 --> 02:18.270
As you can see the more I get the more currencies I'm checking or in general the more things I want

02:18.270 --> 02:22.790
to check the more indentions I need and the more weird.

02:22.800 --> 02:24.530
I'd say look my code looks.

02:24.630 --> 02:31.020
So in this case I have an if statement then in the else I check the next if in the else I check the

02:31.020 --> 02:31.820
negative.

02:31.860 --> 02:37.680
And while that is valid code and it totally works and it's totally fine and it might people be people

02:37.680 --> 02:44.020
who prefer this style it's usually not the best way to do it the better way is to use elif.

02:44.160 --> 02:50.710
And what else does is it checks if a additional condition is true.

02:50.880 --> 02:57.150
And let's just see this particular example in an olive example.

02:57.150 --> 03:01.080
So instead of using ELSE I'M CHECKING L..

03:01.560 --> 03:10.270
If so Elif currency is un then please go ahead and do that.

03:10.380 --> 03:11.320
The same here.

03:11.520 --> 03:13.100
Else if.

03:13.100 --> 03:22.080
Or if currency is going to be Euro then please print euro and the same here.

03:22.080 --> 03:30.090
So let me get rid of the in or not required characters and I'm going to go back.

03:30.150 --> 03:32.920
So that would be the Elif version.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.790
So it's exactly the same result that we get.

03:37.110 --> 03:41.290
But that looks a lot cleaner and it's a lot easier to read.

03:41.490 --> 03:47.760
So we have this if statement checking out currency is equal to dollar.

03:47.790 --> 03:48.780
And if that's the case.

03:48.780 --> 03:49.900
Print dollar.

03:49.980 --> 03:50.790
Else if.

03:50.790 --> 03:51.700
Or elif.

03:51.720 --> 03:56.430
So if this is not the case then please go ahead and check that.

03:56.610 --> 03:58.980
And if it's true then execute this code.

03:59.010 --> 04:04.500
If it's not true then check the next one and execute the code if it's true or if the next one is true

04:04.800 --> 04:05.720
and so forth.

04:05.910 --> 04:07.680
But there is one thing to consider.

04:07.770 --> 04:14.100
That's really important because if this statement here is true then that statement will never be executed

04:14.100 --> 04:15.710
neither that no nor that.

04:15.810 --> 04:23.600
So if one of them is true the following ones within the same statements are within the same connection

04:23.640 --> 04:26.550
will not be executed at all.

04:26.550 --> 04:37.500
So in our case let's say I have dollar or euro here and I have another one in between me who run it

04:37.500 --> 04:44.280
like that and I'm going to say you wrote to here and if I execute that euro two will not be printed

04:44.280 --> 04:44.540
out.

04:44.550 --> 04:51.090
Even though this statement is as true as that one and that is because it's getting out of the whole

04:51.120 --> 04:57.660
if statement as soon as one of the statements is true that is a very very important concept because

04:57.690 --> 05:02.320
if I do things like this later on.

05:02.330 --> 05:07.830
I'm going to check for currency here within the if statement and execute that as you can see that works

05:07.950 --> 05:10.170
easily unify like that.

05:10.170 --> 05:12.280
Now that works perfectly right.

05:12.300 --> 05:17.430
Because this is a completely new statement but this one here is completely connected.

05:17.430 --> 05:24.360
And as you can see you simply use this keyword Elif and it's tense for else if and that's a general

05:24.360 --> 05:27.290
approach for else.

05:27.720 --> 05:31.250
So once again what's the advantage of using this approach.

05:31.440 --> 05:35.600
Over that one here it's mainly the readability.

05:35.670 --> 05:38.060
And secondly it's the correct style.
