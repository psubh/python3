<p>When learning a programming language, it is important that you have real-world experience and are able to develop your own programs.</p><p>I've provided you with an exercise sheet here. Have a look at the file "Finish Python Basics", there you will find some tasks :) </p><p>You can find this exercise sheet in the course materials you downloaded in the first section. It is in the folder "02, 03 - Python Bascis".</p><p>Enjoy working on this exercise!</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: To open.ipynb files, you must first start your Jupyter environment (see section 1). From this environment you can then select and open the file. A single double click on the.ipynb file does not work.</p>
