00:00.450 --> 00:01.480
Welcome back.

00:01.500 --> 00:09.630
Now it's time to add another checkbox because I will show you how you can go ahead and add functionality

00:09.630 --> 00:11.880
to the button via Python code.

00:11.910 --> 00:17.190
So I created this additional checkbox here and now what I want to happen is when somebody presses this

00:17.190 --> 00:23.730
push button this checkbox should be activated by our signals and slots here at the bottom which we have

00:23.730 --> 00:24.820
already created.

00:24.960 --> 00:32.610
And the second checkbox this one here should be handled by our Python code and how we can do that is

00:32.610 --> 00:33.270
the following way.

00:33.270 --> 00:39.480
First of all we need to have an identifier for this checkbox and identifies this object name.

00:39.600 --> 00:46.400
So we can of course call a checkbox to or we could just call it Sibi which is short for check box.

00:46.710 --> 00:53.610
So now if I want to access this checkbox let me save this file real quick and go back to Python.

00:53.970 --> 01:00.300
And here I need to make sure that I run my build so that changes are applied.

01:00.310 --> 01:06.390
So now I can go back to my main window by and check if I can find something called sibi.

01:06.600 --> 01:12.790
And you can see there is something called self Sibi which is a cutey widget checkbox.

01:12.810 --> 01:17.470
So a queue check box which has the object name of c.b.

01:17.800 --> 01:21.690
All right so now we can go ahead and access that Sibi any time you want.

01:21.690 --> 01:22.630
How do we do that.

01:22.800 --> 01:34.440
Well in here we can pretty much just said the check box and call its toggle method but that's not exactly

01:34.440 --> 01:37.780
how it works because the C-B is within UI window.

01:37.980 --> 01:42.340
So we need to tell it OK I want to x as you window Dotsie B.

01:42.480 --> 01:44.790
And from that I want to apply all onto that.

01:44.790 --> 01:46.400
I want to apply to toggle method.

01:46.680 --> 01:49.000
But when do we actually want to apply that.

01:49.170 --> 01:53.450
Well we want to apply it once somebody presses on a button.

01:53.640 --> 01:56.930
So let's create a little method that should handle button clicks.

01:56.940 --> 02:00.870
So I'm just going to say on partan underscore click.

02:00.870 --> 02:06.810
So if somebody clicks the button I just want to print something like an button click was pressed or

02:06.810 --> 02:14.990
something like that on a button click and hearsay pressed or caught.

02:15.180 --> 02:17.640
So this method was called.

02:17.820 --> 02:20.670
Now how do I actually call it from a button.

02:21.030 --> 02:24.180
Well I need to go to the button itself.

02:24.180 --> 02:32.330
So the button is within my window which is my main window which pretty much contains all of my UI elements.

02:32.370 --> 02:36.550
So the checkboxes to button and so forth.

02:36.600 --> 02:45.800
So here I will check my button which I called my button and I can go to click it.

02:45.870 --> 02:58.280
So there is a method called clicked and I can connect that to my on button click.

02:58.380 --> 03:04.530
So that's pretty much the procedure you need to have the name of the UI main window which I called you

03:04.530 --> 03:09.030
my window do you need to have the name of the button which I called my button so let's go back real

03:09.030 --> 03:10.190
quick to check.

03:10.620 --> 03:13.890
And here this button is called My button.

03:13.890 --> 03:17.670
And that's really important because that's exactly the identifier of the button.

03:17.670 --> 03:20.060
And that's exactly the one that we need to use here.

03:20.280 --> 03:22.260
So I want to access my button.

03:22.260 --> 03:29.040
There is something called clicked and I want to connect that clicked with my function that I created

03:29.040 --> 03:32.330
myself which is does the on button click.

03:32.640 --> 03:39.160
So now once somebody clicks on the button it will pretty much print on button clicked kalt.

03:39.420 --> 03:44.730
And before we run that there is one LITTLE thing that I need to change because here it says on button

03:44.730 --> 03:45.600
click.

03:45.810 --> 03:49.800
But I don't want to call the on button click method in here.

03:49.920 --> 03:53.340
I just want to pass it as the argument here.

03:53.340 --> 03:59.130
So I'm just passing this method as an argument so it just kind of call it automatically OK.

03:59.250 --> 04:01.130
So don't call the method in here.

04:01.170 --> 04:02.530
Don't use the brackets here.

04:02.640 --> 04:05.350
Just pass the method name.

04:05.550 --> 04:14.840
And now we can run our main white and press the push button and as you can see on button click called.

04:14.920 --> 04:16.900
But then the other button is still disappearing.

04:16.900 --> 04:18.490
So how do we fix that.

04:18.490 --> 04:20.030
Well just a second.

04:20.050 --> 04:25.240
So just once again you see on button clicked was called and that's always good to check with a print

04:25.240 --> 04:25.780
statement.

04:25.780 --> 04:31.120
Whether your interactivity works so whether button clicks and those kind of things whether they work

04:31.390 --> 04:35.710
before you add functionality in here and then you're wondering why the functionality is not working.

04:35.860 --> 04:40.520
Because after you checked the print statement then you will see directly OK.

04:40.720 --> 04:45.850
The functionality works then we can add some other stuff in here so we could add whatever we wanted

04:46.120 --> 04:49.040
in this function and it would be called and executed.

04:49.030 --> 04:50.670
Once somebody presses a button.

04:50.860 --> 04:53.360
But now the checkbox disappeared how would we fix that.

04:53.380 --> 04:57.780
Well let's go to our cute creator and here instead of hiding.

04:57.910 --> 05:02.550
Let's change that to toggle because we don't want to hide it anymore we just want to toggle it.

05:02.860 --> 05:09.820
So let me say that again and I will stop the main and I will run build once again real quick because

05:09.820 --> 05:12.350
I made some changes in the cube Ed..

05:12.730 --> 05:20.290
Now we can go ahead and run main once again and you will see that this checkbox is active and active

05:20.650 --> 05:22.600
or it's toggled pretty much.

05:22.630 --> 05:26.660
So now I want to toggle the checkbox.

05:26.710 --> 05:27.690
How do we do that.

05:27.790 --> 05:35.380
Well as I told you earlier we need to access you I windowed CB So we access the checkbox itself and

05:35.380 --> 05:38.410
there we need to call the toggle method.

05:38.470 --> 05:44.820
So there is this toggle method that pretty much toggles to element and an toggle switch.

05:44.830 --> 05:54.600
So if I save that and run it again you will see that both my checkboxes now get toggled by my push button.

05:54.740 --> 05:55.540
All right.

05:55.780 --> 05:59.530
And now there is something that you can actually do as well.

05:59.590 --> 06:08.710
So instead of creating this method which really just does one thing and it toggles our checkbox I can

06:08.710 --> 06:15.190
just add the name of the method in here as well because this here is also a method name so I could just

06:15.190 --> 06:18.100
say OK just past the toggle method in here.

06:18.100 --> 06:20.640
So then we don't need this code here anymore.

06:20.660 --> 06:24.040
So I'm just going to comment it out.

06:24.510 --> 06:25.020
All right.

06:25.030 --> 06:31.770
Now let me run the code again just to see whether it's still working and you can see it's still working.

06:31.780 --> 06:33.030
Now there's one more thing.

06:33.040 --> 06:40.520
So we have this code here and we have a very similar code here which says self my button clicked connect.

06:40.600 --> 06:42.370
So checkbox toggle.

06:42.460 --> 06:50.120
So it's pretty much the same kind of code only that here we are accessing the checkbox and not the CB.

06:50.170 --> 07:00.040
So this main window Y contains this same kind of code and it's automatically created based on the signals

07:00.100 --> 07:02.410
and slots and tree that we have here.

07:02.670 --> 07:03.360
OK.

07:03.490 --> 07:05.740
So that's how everything is pretty much connected.

07:05.740 --> 07:11.470
And now you could go ahead and create the methods you like and you can put them in there so that may

07:11.470 --> 07:14.980
actually come in this line out as well.

07:14.980 --> 07:20.630
So you can see both versions out like that.

07:20.840 --> 07:21.220
OK.

07:21.250 --> 07:23.510
So these are the two versions that we could use either.

07:23.580 --> 07:27.140
We use the one with comment that we have commented out.

07:27.280 --> 07:32.710
Or the one that we have here which is just one line but this only makes sense if you really just do

07:32.710 --> 07:37.990
this one thing if we had more things that should happen for example we print something on the screen

07:37.990 --> 07:40.170
then we do some calculations and so forth.

07:40.180 --> 07:47.200
In this method then it would make sense to use this or pass this method instead of passing this very

07:47.200 --> 07:49.070
basic code.

07:49.090 --> 07:51.450
I just wanted to show you that this is also possible.

07:51.720 --> 07:52.210
OK.

07:52.270 --> 07:56.730
So in the next video we are going to check out how to structure.

07:56.810 --> 07:59.800
Well we're going to restructure our co-promote so see you there.
