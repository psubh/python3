00:00.240 --> 00:06.940
You've seen multiple operators already and the one we are going to look at now is a membership operator.

00:06.950 --> 00:14.070
When it's called in in Python's membership operator's test for membership in a sequence such as a string

00:14.130 --> 00:18.760
a list or a tuple and there are two membership operators.

00:18.870 --> 00:24.780
One is the n and the other one is not in and we're going to look at the two operators in this in the

00:24.780 --> 00:25.590
next video.

00:25.770 --> 00:28.890
So let's go ahead and start with the in operator defer.

00:28.890 --> 00:35.790
I'm going to create a list of students and I'm going to use my standard list with Max.

00:35.880 --> 00:39.920
Monica then Eric.

00:40.050 --> 00:43.300
And finally Fran Cisco.

00:43.920 --> 00:44.250
All right.

00:44.250 --> 00:49.680
So this is my list and I want to print whether a specific name.

00:49.680 --> 00:57.580
So let's say Monica is within the list and I'm just going to say in students.

00:57.580 --> 00:59.010
So let's execute that.

00:59.100 --> 01:01.960
And as you can see we get the statement through.

01:02.340 --> 01:03.190
Why is that.

01:03.210 --> 01:10.740
Because Monica has a string exactly written as I have it here is within my list students and that's

01:10.740 --> 01:12.150
a pretty cool feature.

01:12.150 --> 01:16.680
So let's check out another line where we check the same thing for another name.

01:16.680 --> 01:23.520
Let's say Moe in students and it's executed.

01:23.550 --> 01:29.280
And as you can see we get the false return because MO is not part of that list.

01:29.400 --> 01:36.910
Now this of course is a very basic and not that useful functionality in this way.

01:36.930 --> 01:37.850
In this version.

01:38.070 --> 01:44.490
But we can use it in a very useful way for example in the if statement so we can just say okay is Monica

01:44.580 --> 01:46.350
in my list students.

01:46.560 --> 01:50.890
And if that is true then please print something like yes.

01:50.920 --> 01:54.530
Monica studies here.

01:54.990 --> 01:56.000
So let's execute that.

01:56.010 --> 01:57.630
And as you can see we get this statement.

01:57.630 --> 01:59.160
Yes Monica studies here.

01:59.340 --> 02:02.560
Now let's check the same thing with Maurits.

02:02.640 --> 02:06.300
So I'm going to copy and paste that code.

02:06.450 --> 02:14.370
So I'm just going to say Mo in students and then I would just say some Valev mo studies you know execute

02:14.370 --> 02:17.510
that and as you can see this statement here is not true.

02:17.560 --> 02:19.560
Samoa is not within students.

02:19.680 --> 02:21.750
And that's what this whole thing doesn't work.

02:22.110 --> 02:26.790
All right now let's check out else here as well because we can use else of course as well.

02:26.790 --> 02:31.320
And Prince on for like no Monica does.

02:31.470 --> 02:35.210
And study here.

02:35.430 --> 02:39.040
Now let's run that for Monica.

02:39.140 --> 02:42.690
There's nothing happening but let's check it out for Mo.

02:43.070 --> 02:46.660
And it's going to say mo doesn't study here no that's printed.

02:46.700 --> 02:50.100
And as you can see no mold doesn't study here.

02:50.150 --> 02:58.080
So this statement here is actually executed because this statement is not true.

02:58.160 --> 03:04.800
So Mo is not within the students and that it by itself is already pretty cool.

03:04.820 --> 03:12.150
But there is something even cooler and that is that this also works for strengths.

03:12.260 --> 03:15.360
So let's check out an example with strings.

03:16.190 --> 03:19.400
Let's write a little sentence sentence.

03:19.450 --> 03:21.160
I'm just going to say yes.

03:21.190 --> 03:24.330
Monica I'm just going to copy the code from here.

03:24.620 --> 03:24.980
Yes.

03:24.990 --> 03:26.170
Monica studies here.

03:26.210 --> 03:27.360
Let's do that.

03:27.500 --> 03:31.930
And let's add an exclamation mark at the end of this very basic sentence.

03:32.420 --> 03:40.170
And I can not check if a particular string is in sentence.

03:40.310 --> 03:41.630
So I'm checking.

03:41.660 --> 03:46.270
Is this sign within the sentence.

03:46.340 --> 03:50.440
And if that is true then I'm just going to print.

03:51.290 --> 03:52.050
Yes.

03:52.340 --> 03:55.040
And actually as a string guess I like that.

03:55.040 --> 03:55.990
Now let's execute that.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.670
And as you can see printing is executed.

03:58.670 --> 03:59.270
Let's check out.

03:59.270 --> 04:00.980
Else.

04:00.980 --> 04:01.710
Print.

04:01.970 --> 04:03.210
No.

04:03.890 --> 04:05.780
And now let's use a different sign.

04:05.780 --> 04:11.180
Let's use a something like is a B in there.

04:11.420 --> 04:12.360
So let's execute.

04:12.410 --> 04:19.190
And as you can see there is no B in this whole sentence or we can even go as far as I know there's no

04:19.190 --> 04:22.270
in the sentence and it says no no he's not in the sentence.

04:22.370 --> 04:28.310
So you can use to add four strings and that is super super useful because now you can simply check if

04:28.310 --> 04:35.780
a specific character or a specific term is within your string and you could use Ted for example to search

04:35.780 --> 04:39.870
for documents because documents in the end are also just drinks.

04:40.040 --> 04:44.870
And it goes for Web sites as well Web sites are usually just documents right.

04:44.930 --> 04:50.720
Or at least the basic concept of web sites the mail code are just documents which you can read and then

04:50.720 --> 04:56.640
you can check if a specific term is in there and execute something if you find that term.

04:56.870 --> 04:58.780
And that will be superpowerful.

04:58.790 --> 05:01.620
All right so that's the in membership.

05:01.670 --> 05:06.070
Operator And we're going to check out the not in membership.

05:06.080 --> 05:08.090
Operator in the next video.

05:08.120 --> 05:09.250
So see you there.
