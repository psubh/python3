00:00.840 --> 00:01.580
Welcome back.

00:01.590 --> 00:09.990
In this video I would like to show you how you can play around with your UI and the idea behind this

00:09.990 --> 00:16.380
video is to show you how it's done with this table widget but you can pretty much do that with any other

00:16.410 --> 00:20.040
element that you see in your eyes here.

00:20.040 --> 00:26.670
So the idea is that you can see here on the ride plenty of properties which you can change.

00:26.670 --> 00:31.950
So currently I have the button selected and there are already quite some elements that I can change

00:32.100 --> 00:38.520
or properties that I can change but if I press on the widget here and this table would then then I get

00:38.580 --> 00:44.500
so many more as you can see there are plenty that can change all the cue widget once.

00:44.580 --> 00:47.680
So as you know they are inheriting from each other right.

00:47.700 --> 00:51.970
So you can see there is a very long inheritance here.

00:52.050 --> 00:57.810
Heather is inheriting from table widget table widget is inheriting from table view which is inheriting

00:57.810 --> 01:02.970
from an abstract item view which is inherited from an abstract scroll area from frame from widget from

01:03.360 --> 01:07.220
object so you can see a long hierarchy here.

01:07.350 --> 01:09.190
But let's say we look at the header here.

01:09.210 --> 01:10.540
Let's start from the bottom.

01:10.620 --> 01:13.770
So we have this header let me make this a little wider.

01:13.950 --> 01:16.140
And it's not appearing in my case.

01:16.880 --> 01:18.260
It's not cool.

01:18.330 --> 01:19.560
It's at the bottom the top here.

01:19.640 --> 01:20.210
OK.

01:20.300 --> 01:22.280
So I dragged this to the side.

01:22.700 --> 01:29.780
And now I can change value So for example the header which is this header here at the top.

01:29.780 --> 01:34.550
I can make so that the vertical header is invisible so let me uncheck it.

01:34.550 --> 01:41.060
You can see that the vertical one so the numbers that we had at the left is suddenly invisible so that

01:41.210 --> 01:44.210
activated again suddenly it's back there again.

01:44.210 --> 01:49.000
Same for the horizontal head are visible so I can deactivate it.

01:49.070 --> 01:50.110
Suddenly it's gone.

01:50.110 --> 01:53.330
So we don't see City and inhabitants anymore.

01:53.900 --> 02:00.710
And by the way this year other side here in this wooded area here on the right hand side is moving all

02:00.710 --> 02:08.660
the time for me and that has to do with my set up of my window so I have made the Y bigger so you can

02:08.660 --> 02:09.460
see better.

02:09.470 --> 02:14.830
But that's the side effect that I get so I have to drag it all the time.

02:15.230 --> 02:17.140
If you find a solution for that let me know.

02:17.190 --> 02:19.890
And in your case hopefully you don't have this issue.

02:20.150 --> 02:29.760
But usually you shouldn't get this issue when you have the standard size of your Newfies in Windows.

02:29.810 --> 02:32.620
In my case I used a custom one that's why I get this.

02:32.860 --> 02:33.100
OK.

02:33.110 --> 02:39.380
So get back to the headers and back to generally changing properties.

02:39.380 --> 02:45.140
So you see these are just some examples of the properties I could say horizontal head or defaults section

02:45.150 --> 02:48.050
size should not be 139 pixels.

02:48.170 --> 02:52.460
But let's say it's 200 pixels and you suddenly see that it's a lot wider.

02:52.460 --> 02:55.480
So I have a much wider standard.

02:55.550 --> 02:58.330
Of course if you run this you can still added it.

02:58.490 --> 03:00.220
At least that's the standard.

03:00.440 --> 03:07.370
You could even activate the highlight sections here stretch last section.

03:07.380 --> 03:14.680
So we get to that image activated you can see it stretches it to do with the screen.

03:14.680 --> 03:15.850
I personally like that.

03:15.860 --> 03:21.860
I think it's a good thing so it stretches on the width of our whole window that we have here.

03:22.400 --> 03:28.460
Then if we go a little bit up so that's the header you can play around with those values.

03:28.730 --> 03:32.880
I would really recommend to do that but check out the table view.

03:33.240 --> 03:34.650
Showbread Well we have this grid.

03:34.670 --> 03:36.680
We could even deactivate that.

03:36.680 --> 03:38.060
So let me get rid of this.

03:38.070 --> 03:44.120
You can see there is no grit anymore so I only have the values in there now or if I want to make this

03:44.120 --> 03:45.200
a different type of line.

03:45.200 --> 03:49.150
So now I have a solid line but it could be a dashed line.

03:49.310 --> 03:51.520
You know I have plenty of dashes there.

03:51.630 --> 03:56.870
So you see a lot of changes that we can do or we can make here.

03:56.930 --> 03:58.710
So then abstract item.

03:59.090 --> 04:00.590
We can all the scroll.

04:00.680 --> 04:04.620
So we can add a scroll bar we can drag enabled.

04:04.640 --> 04:11.540
Well it's not unable to in our case we could activate dragging we could change icons last where we don't

04:11.540 --> 04:12.180
have icons.

04:12.200 --> 04:12.790
OK.

04:12.800 --> 04:14.590
So just play around with those values.

04:14.600 --> 04:17.910
But there is something that I still would like to show you.

04:17.970 --> 04:20.270
And in enqueue widget.

04:20.510 --> 04:28.700
So in here or actually it's not even in key widget because we've used widget a lot but it's not an abstract

04:28.760 --> 04:29.770
item you.

04:29.960 --> 04:32.680
So there is something called added Trigger's which is pretty cool.

04:32.720 --> 04:39.590
So let's check this out adage triggers are as you can see here there's a list of added triggers double

04:39.590 --> 04:42.870
clicked added key pressed any key pressed key.

04:42.900 --> 04:44.140
What does that mean.

04:44.150 --> 04:45.070
Let's check it out.

04:45.110 --> 04:48.800
Let's go back to Parcher and run our application.

04:48.800 --> 04:52.460
And now I can double click here and change de-value.

04:52.940 --> 04:59.480
But I can also just select it and change the value by typing something or I can press enter and then

04:59.480 --> 05:00.440
change the value.

05:00.650 --> 05:03.850
So these are pretty much the changes that we allow here.

05:04.070 --> 05:07.980
And that is based on what we have selected here.

05:08.150 --> 05:11.700
So under added triggers an abstract item you.

05:11.900 --> 05:18.540
So you can even say something like No added triggers if we actually read that then all the others are

05:18.540 --> 05:19.980
the activated as you can see.

05:20.000 --> 05:27.440
So double clicked with this de-activated and any key press deactivated so let me save that real quick

05:27.800 --> 05:29.790
and go back to PI charm.

05:29.840 --> 05:35.980
Then of course rebuild my built or rerun my build recompile it once that is done.

05:36.020 --> 05:38.560
I run my main again to run the application.

05:38.960 --> 05:44.120
And now let me double click no changes and just something no changes.

05:44.120 --> 05:46.070
Press Enter no changes.

05:46.070 --> 05:48.950
So no I cannot interact with the data anymore.

05:49.490 --> 05:51.050
And now you might say.

05:51.050 --> 05:53.230
All right so what's the use of it then.

05:53.360 --> 05:59.360
Well the use could be that you for example can write a little program which will then block it so you

05:59.360 --> 06:00.840
can make some changes.

06:00.860 --> 06:06.680
But then as soon as you press safe for example you cannot edited anymore or you press safe and then

06:06.680 --> 06:09.580
you send it to someone and nobody can edit it or something like that.

06:09.620 --> 06:18.350
So you could pretty much use that technology in your advantage or to you do it to your advantage.

06:18.350 --> 06:23.580
So let's go back here and let's go back to the default value so no added triggered.

06:23.810 --> 06:35.690
Well I'm going to say double clicked and I'm going I say added he pressed and you keep pressed as well.

06:36.080 --> 06:42.490
Actually there's even something called all added triggers so selected click then current changes so

06:42.490 --> 06:47.230
you can pretty much say all the triggers should be active or none of them.

06:47.330 --> 06:52.430
So you can see under Edit triggers you can find all of those different trigger properties and you could

06:52.430 --> 06:56.030
even access those via a code.

06:56.040 --> 06:56.940
All right.

06:57.190 --> 07:03.910
So I'm going to stop here because I could of course go on and on but all of those properties here.

07:03.940 --> 07:06.110
But that's not really the idea of this video.

07:06.130 --> 07:14.890
The idea is that use the objects that you want to use so use the widgets and buttons and containers

07:14.920 --> 07:22.210
and stuff like that and then check out the properties just to see what you can change just to see how

07:22.210 --> 07:28.540
you can improve the UI that it does what you wanted to do that it looks like what you wanted to do and

07:28.540 --> 07:29.300
so forth.

07:29.560 --> 07:31.740
So that's really the idea behind this video.

07:31.750 --> 07:37.350
So that's just for you to want to see that.

07:37.390 --> 07:43.570
Once again we have used it already before but you saw some more examples of what you can do and what

07:43.570 --> 07:45.670
you can do with a particular widget.

07:45.670 --> 07:52.950
So the properties of a particular widget or a particular button or container there they differ.

07:53.140 --> 07:59.080
So they are different for pretty much any of them because as you can see they might inherit from the

07:59.080 --> 08:04.450
same classes but then they have something that is different for themselves.

08:04.450 --> 08:07.980
So for that particular element that you're looking at.

08:08.310 --> 08:08.770
OK.

08:08.830 --> 08:10.950
So I'd say that's good for now.

08:10.960 --> 08:18.010
And let's check on the next video where we are going to react to changes in cells and we're going to

08:18.010 --> 08:19.720
check out the documentation as well.

08:19.750 --> 08:20.900
So see you there.
