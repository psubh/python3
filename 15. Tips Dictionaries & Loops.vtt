00:00.210 --> 00:06.150
All right in this way you would like to give you some additional preparation advice on how to solve

00:06.150 --> 00:07.620
the challenge.

00:07.650 --> 00:11.000
The exercise that you have gotten for in the last video.

00:11.190 --> 00:18.690
So your task is to use dictionaries in order to find out which name is the one that was given most in

00:18.690 --> 00:22.610
the U.S. and therefore you need to check something.

00:22.800 --> 00:29.540
And I will show you something with this list one where we have hello hello world.

00:29.550 --> 00:34.800
Hello and Marcy in there and now I would like to know how often hello is in there.

00:35.100 --> 00:40.830
And I also would like to know which word it is that is that often so the word hello is three times the

00:40.840 --> 00:46.490
word word world is on the ones in there and the word is ones in there as well.

00:46.500 --> 00:50.500
So if we create a dictionary Let's go ahead and do that.

00:50.550 --> 00:52.770
Let's create an empty dictionary.

00:53.070 --> 00:58.790
And now I would like to go through my list one.

00:59.190 --> 01:06.630
And if the element that I'm looking at so with this for loop would go through every single element within

01:06.630 --> 01:10.170
my list every single item pretty much in the list.

01:10.320 --> 01:19.120
And if the element in my dictionary was at the beginning is empty is existent.

01:19.170 --> 01:24.480
So which means that this word is already in my dictionary.

01:24.480 --> 01:31.260
Then please go ahead and add the elements.

01:31.320 --> 01:38.880
Position the value that you had before plus 1.

01:39.510 --> 01:45.620
So we always have a dictionary as you know it consists of a key and a value key value.

01:45.930 --> 01:52.890
So we are going through the list and then we're going through or checking it comparing it pretty much

01:52.890 --> 01:53.960
with a dictionary.

01:54.150 --> 02:00.720
So if it already exists so halo already exists in the dictionary as you know a key can only be unique

02:00.750 --> 02:06.100
within a dictionary so hello will only be in there once so it will not be in there twice or something

02:06.100 --> 02:09.540
not that world will only be in there once and that's the same for name.

02:09.540 --> 02:14.710
So Frank will only be there once and Michael will only be there once and so forth.

02:14.790 --> 02:16.640
So we check.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.500
Is this name already in the list.

02:18.510 --> 02:27.650
Yes if it is OK then please go ahead and as the name and its position get at the value that it had before

02:27.950 --> 02:30.480
and had won.

02:30.540 --> 02:43.830
So now this name will be there an additional time and else just say that element is there once because

02:44.190 --> 02:50.190
if it was not in the dictionary for as it is at the beginning Can we just add or we just assign the

02:50.190 --> 02:51.510
value one.

02:51.630 --> 02:56.100
Now let's print the after this for you and you will see what I mean.

02:56.280 --> 03:02.050
So we have this dictionary the dictionary which had the key.

03:02.080 --> 03:04.710
Hello Has the value 3 Add world.

03:04.710 --> 03:07.620
It has one and Amar's it has one as well.

03:07.620 --> 03:15.130
And that's because the value Hello ordered text Hello is there three times in this list.

03:15.240 --> 03:22.590
So that's how you can simply use a dictionary and for loop in order to figure out how many occurrences

03:22.950 --> 03:25.170
a specific name has.

03:25.190 --> 03:25.730
Right.

03:26.040 --> 03:33.270
But that's not enough because you don't only want to know how many occurrences a specific name has you

03:33.270 --> 03:36.750
want to know which name is the one with the maximum occurrence.

03:36.750 --> 03:45.220
So the one that has most namings makes all Karoon since there's going to be zero.

03:45.570 --> 03:49.160
And now we need to use tuple unpacking.

03:49.170 --> 03:54.100
So we say QI come of value in Deedat items.

03:54.120 --> 04:01.680
So now we go through all the items in our dictionary and we check if Max occurrences

04:04.290 --> 04:13.030
is greater than the value of our specific entry of our item within the dictionary.

04:13.200 --> 04:23.700
And if that's the case then let's say Max occurrences is going to be the value and then print the max

04:23.700 --> 04:26.750
occurrences just to see what they are.

04:26.810 --> 04:29.140
And as you can see we get the value three.

04:29.220 --> 04:37.010
So now we will know which is the highest value in terms of namings.

04:37.230 --> 04:44.430
And of course you can also just print out the key in order to find out what the name is with the maximum

04:44.430 --> 04:45.170
occurences.

04:45.210 --> 04:46.760
So this is just a hint right.

04:46.800 --> 04:49.750
I'm not giving you the full answer already.

04:50.190 --> 04:55.770
But generally speaking that's how you can approach to this whole challenge.

04:55.770 --> 05:00.160
So this for loop is really just there to figure out what is the highest number.

05:00.410 --> 05:04.090
And also to figure out what the name is.

05:04.190 --> 05:12.950
This one here is to accumulate all the namings in order to create a list of all the names with their

05:12.950 --> 05:13.640
values.

05:13.640 --> 05:18.710
So with how many people were named with this name in the U.S..

05:18.710 --> 05:21.870
All right so good luck and see you in the next video.
