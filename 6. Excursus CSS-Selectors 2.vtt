00:00.370 --> 00:05.910
We'll come back in this video I would like to talk to you about some other aspects of C as selectors

00:06.000 --> 00:08.700
and also another tech that we haven't looked at.

00:08.910 --> 00:15.390
So there is something called a div tech and it's pretty much something like a container so we can contain

00:15.390 --> 00:17.620
multiple things within a DIV tag.

00:17.790 --> 00:23.940
So we could say something like OK I've created this this tag and in year I could go ahead and add two

00:24.210 --> 00:26.490
tags something like that.

00:26.490 --> 00:30.800
So now this div tag contains those two tags.

00:30.810 --> 00:36.410
And if I execute that code you will see OK I have just added two more lines in here.

00:36.840 --> 00:39.690
But now there is an advantage of using this tax.

00:39.690 --> 00:47.060
For example if we look at our Web site here this little block here that we have is within a div container.

00:47.070 --> 00:53.830
So if we look at it we can see it's within this container called Card block or with the class card block.

00:54.270 --> 00:59.240
OK so we have another container with the class card block and so forth.

00:59.520 --> 01:02.160
So let's have a look at device and how we used them.

01:02.340 --> 01:06.250
So I have this div and I'm going to give it a class as well.

01:06.390 --> 01:12.460
I'm going to call it P or part 1.

01:12.550 --> 01:15.990
There's just going to be my class part 1 and then and there.

01:15.990 --> 01:24.840
I would like to have a P-TECH which just says something like I am a paragraph but part 1 and I don't

01:24.840 --> 01:26.510
want to have the second one.

01:26.700 --> 01:29.370
And also it won't have this class for now.

01:29.820 --> 01:36.470
OK so now I just have this very basic tag here and let me clean it up a little bit.

01:36.480 --> 01:38.300
We don't need all of this additional space.

01:38.310 --> 01:38.930
OK.

01:39.000 --> 01:44.730
And I'm going to create a different DIV tag just below that and this will be part 2 for example.

01:44.730 --> 01:48.430
Now in here I have different content which is part 2.

01:48.600 --> 01:55.530
And now what I can do is for example I can say I would like to change this particular P-TECH without

01:55.560 --> 02:02.300
even touching the P-TECH where I could even change all the pieces within a specific task.

02:02.340 --> 02:03.490
And how do I do that.

02:03.690 --> 02:12.660
Well you can use dot part 1 in order to access this class or modify this class which is called Part

02:12.660 --> 02:17.150
1 and then you can add something like the P for example.

02:17.490 --> 02:24.730
So let's have a look at that where we change all the text within a Part 1 class.

02:25.170 --> 02:33.430
And here I could just say something like font weight should be bold.

02:33.450 --> 02:35.850
So now it's going to be bold.

02:35.910 --> 02:37.460
This part here will be written.

02:37.470 --> 02:41.690
So let's save and refresh and you can see part 1.

02:41.730 --> 02:47.460
I mean paragraph is bold now part 2 in the paragraph is not bold.

02:47.460 --> 02:51.450
So only this part here is bold even though I said the font weight.

02:51.450 --> 03:00.810
Bold but I said that it should only apply to Peter x which are within a C part of one class and that's

03:00.810 --> 03:01.530
the case here.

03:01.530 --> 03:06.870
So I created this little container with this div tag and added this paragraph in there.

03:06.870 --> 03:14.390
So let me create another paragraph in there save it and refresh and you can see now I have part 1.

03:14.380 --> 03:18.300
I'm a paragraph part one I'm a paragraph so both of them are bold.

03:18.360 --> 03:26.130
So all the tags within my class part 1 will be bold now because I defined it in here so you can pretty

03:26.130 --> 03:27.910
much do whatever you want you could.

03:28.050 --> 03:31.240
Let's say we have this clause important in there as well.

03:31.590 --> 03:42.100
So if you use important and so only important within the tag of part one will be bold.

03:42.150 --> 03:46.790
Now of course important is a class so we need to add the dot here as well.

03:47.100 --> 03:52.770
OK so now if I saved that and I refresh my side you see me paragraph.

03:52.770 --> 03:54.520
Now is written in bold.

03:54.810 --> 03:57.670
That's because it is in red and in bold.

03:57.720 --> 04:03.760
That's because this third paragraph here is within a day that has the class Part 1.

04:03.930 --> 04:07.860
And at the same time the P-TECH itself has the class.

04:07.860 --> 04:08.750
Important.

04:08.940 --> 04:14.810
That's why only this P-TECH here is actually influenced by that.

04:14.820 --> 04:23.580
All right so quickly to sum it up once again you can create multiple tags in hemo and you can create

04:23.580 --> 04:26.650
diff tasks which pretty much are containers.

04:26.880 --> 04:33.770
Then you can have the tags and multiple other types of text like I m g text for images and so forth.

04:33.780 --> 04:38.010
There are plenty of text if you want to know more about the text you can of course always check out

04:38.040 --> 04:39.810
aged email text or google it.

04:39.990 --> 04:42.860
But that's not really what we're talking about here.

04:42.930 --> 04:49.080
But the idea is that you can use those tasks in order to style them so you can style parts of your website

04:49.680 --> 04:51.330
by using text.

04:51.450 --> 04:58.980
So I can use this approach here where I say OK I have the style tag within the head of my website.

04:58.980 --> 05:06.710
So within the head of my website so I can simply change the style of a specific tag selector.

05:06.830 --> 05:14.210
For example the piece selector or I can change it of a specific class clauses by using the dot and IDs

05:14.210 --> 05:21.380
by using the hash at the beginning and then of course I can change span's or other tags straight away.

05:21.590 --> 05:27.620
And I even can combine that I can combine clauses with clauses so if I say OK I have a container with

05:27.620 --> 05:34.850
a class part one like this div container and I have something with a clause important and I want to

05:34.850 --> 05:39.130
change its font weight property to bolt.

05:39.200 --> 05:44.570
So within the curly brackets you pretty much just say what you want to change and then you ended up

05:44.570 --> 05:45.950
with a semi colon.

05:46.040 --> 05:54.980
So every single statement has to end with a semi-colon in C S S and of course let's go back to just

05:54.980 --> 05:56.210
using a p tag.

05:56.420 --> 06:03.230
Here you can use that as well where you just say OK all the text within my containers with a Part 1

06:03.230 --> 06:05.330
class should be influenced.

06:05.330 --> 06:12.140
So if we check that out again we can see all those three are influenced now and are bold.

06:12.770 --> 06:13.280
OK.

06:13.310 --> 06:22.160
So that basic knowledge here of and C is as will help us to find elements that are relevant for us in

06:22.160 --> 06:25.260
order to cut the website down as we need it.

06:25.460 --> 06:28.090
And that's really just a little excursus.

06:28.100 --> 06:35.810
In order to give you an idea of what this whole HDMI LNC is as does in order to understand better how

06:35.810 --> 06:40.990
we construct or how the website is structured and how we can crawl it correctly.

06:41.000 --> 06:41.310
All right.

06:41.300 --> 06:45.680
So I'd say See you in the next video where we are going to find elements.

06:45.710 --> 06:46.490
So see you there.
