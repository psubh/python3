00:00.610 --> 00:05.610
Come back in this video I would like to talk about table widgets and show you how you can use the table

00:05.610 --> 00:08.910
widget and pretty much create a table in here.

00:08.910 --> 00:12.380
So first of all let's get rid of all the code we don't need here.

00:12.390 --> 00:21.430
So I want to be am I any more and I'm going to get rid of the slipcase.

00:21.510 --> 00:28.890
So the only thing I actually want to have is what we have here and I don't need this button click anymore.

00:28.890 --> 00:32.910
So we're going to create a very different application this time.

00:32.940 --> 00:38.480
So let me save that and go back to cute creator because now I would like to use tables.

00:38.730 --> 00:46.590
So instead of having all of these elements that I have in here I want only to have 8 tables so I will

00:46.590 --> 00:52.960
get rid of this whole form lay out what we had and suddenly all of the buttons are gone as well.

00:53.220 --> 00:55.600
And all of the labels and stuff.

00:55.860 --> 01:03.060
And then I drag in the table widget so that we are table would do this and here and now if I double

01:03.060 --> 01:08.680
click on it you can see it can change the columns or add columns I can add rows and I can add items.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.420
But what I'm going to start with is columns.

01:11.430 --> 01:21.180
So let's say I have these two columns and one is the city name and the other one is the inhabitants

01:21.670 --> 01:23.780
hand be tense.

01:24.140 --> 01:26.930
And now for the rows I'm going to create a new row.

01:27.150 --> 01:32.900
And I'm just going to call this row zero and then I go to items such as you can see this is what I get.

01:32.910 --> 01:34.590
And you call them you call them you roll.

01:34.580 --> 01:40.260
So it didn't take the names that I had before but it at least has the structure that I had.

01:40.260 --> 01:49.200
So let's say I enter Munich here and let's say Munich has one point nine million inhabitants might be

01:49.200 --> 01:50.750
precise or not.

01:50.850 --> 01:56.060
Then I want to add another row so I go back to Rose and this one will be my roll one.

01:56.070 --> 02:03.930
Now I go back to iTunes and here for example and to Berlin which has roughly 4 million inhabitants and

02:04.470 --> 02:05.160
that's pretty much it.

02:05.160 --> 02:11.430
So if I press OK you see that the data is displayed here in my table.

02:11.460 --> 02:16.560
So I'm going to make this table a little smaller or this whole view because I don't need any more than

02:16.560 --> 02:17.120
that.

02:17.300 --> 02:17.630
OK.

02:17.630 --> 02:19.560
Now what I want to add is a button.

02:19.560 --> 02:27.930
So I'm going to add a push button and top of it and just going to say Python action because what I want

02:27.930 --> 02:32.760
to happen is when I press this button and I want to change something in my table.

02:32.980 --> 02:39.000
All right now once we're done with this let's save it and now let's go back to PI charme where we need

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
to run the built in order to reproduce our UI.

02:44.190 --> 02:45.510
And then we can run main.

02:45.510 --> 02:52.620
So let's just do that real quick that we are solving We have Munich and with 1.9 million inhabitants

02:52.620 --> 03:00.210
so as we enter a different value in here and suddenly it has six million five hundred and it's 46000

03:00.280 --> 03:01.100
and so forth.

03:01.110 --> 03:08.070
So I changed it and I can change it any time soon as you can see it could change that to being New York

03:08.070 --> 03:14.580
for example and New York has something like I don't know 10 million inhabitants based on what you're

03:14.580 --> 03:16.520
looking at and.

03:16.760 --> 03:16.990
Yeah.

03:16.990 --> 03:23.990
Now what I want to happen is when I press this button I want to change stuff in this table widget.

03:24.240 --> 03:25.250
How do I do that.

03:25.470 --> 03:29.230
Well first of all I need to have a method for that.

03:29.280 --> 03:36.420
So I'm going to create a new method and this time I'm going to use the naming of heute because I'm really

03:36.420 --> 03:43.890
just using cute anti-fun so I don't need any other imports so I'm just going to use the same naming

03:43.890 --> 03:44.640
convention here.

03:44.640 --> 03:47.940
So on push button click.

03:47.940 --> 03:53.140
So once somebody press this button I want to execute something.

03:53.310 --> 03:59.910
And for now I'm just going to say Button was clicked and now that by itself is not enough because we

03:59.910 --> 04:02.170
need to connect that to the push button.

04:02.310 --> 04:08.250
And if you remember how we did that it was pretty long texts but not that difficult.

04:08.250 --> 04:14.230
So we just access the UI and from the UI the element that we want to connect.

04:14.670 --> 04:17.800
And here we say which event it should be.

04:17.850 --> 04:26.350
So when the click event comes up we want to connect that to self-taught on push button click.

04:26.370 --> 04:32.730
So in this case it's important that we don't call this method but we just pass the method name because

04:32.730 --> 04:38.370
if we actually call the method and here we get an error sort of we stop the application run it again

04:38.880 --> 04:44.280
and you will see that we get an error here because one argument has unexpected type Monotype.

04:44.400 --> 04:47.840
So I'm going to get rid of this and run it again.

04:48.000 --> 04:53.890
And now you see that if I press this button button was clicked is displayed in my console.

04:54.210 --> 04:54.620
OK.

04:54.630 --> 04:55.670
So that's good.

04:55.740 --> 05:00.900
But how do I actually change the value of my table.

05:01.270 --> 05:03.730
Well I can do the following.

05:03.730 --> 05:10.060
I can go in my method here and use self-taught.

05:10.160 --> 05:14.330
You buy that table widget so I can access the table widget.

05:14.350 --> 05:17.760
And here I need to set an item.

05:17.830 --> 05:25.280
So as you can see there is a method called said item which me needs a row column and an item.

05:25.450 --> 05:27.670
OK so let me enter those.

05:27.760 --> 05:31.260
I'd say the roll should be zero the column should be zero.

05:31.270 --> 05:35.140
And then just going to add something like Budapest's in here.

05:36.070 --> 05:39.760
And that won't work because I'm entering a string here.

05:39.910 --> 05:46.110
But what is actually expecting is in a queue table which food item.

05:46.120 --> 05:52.770
So if I run that code and I press the button I should get a crash.

05:54.070 --> 05:59.120
And actually I do get a crash but it somehow doesn't show me the error.

05:59.320 --> 06:02.620
So it doesn't even show me what the problem was.

06:03.280 --> 06:08.550
That is the worst of behaviors when the program just crashes and doesn't even give you the problem here.

06:08.800 --> 06:14.770
But in order to understand a little more what's going on we could check out the said item method in

06:14.770 --> 06:16.510
order to understand more what's going on.

06:16.510 --> 06:24.700
So here is set to method requires a q t.

06:24.700 --> 06:30.620
Widgets are cute widgets dot cue table widget item.

06:30.700 --> 06:32.250
So this one right here.

06:32.470 --> 06:35.980
And as I created this method actually told me that it needs that.

06:35.980 --> 06:45.270
So let me create it again said I turn it can see it says self roll call them item.

06:45.440 --> 06:52.810
And once I entered values here so let's say I want to enter the second value as you can see here displays

06:52.930 --> 06:56.180
item should be of type q table widget item.

06:56.200 --> 06:57.550
So that's exactly what we have here.

06:57.580 --> 06:58.370
Cute.

06:58.570 --> 07:00.780
The table would you add item.

07:00.900 --> 07:03.730
But of course it needs to have a entry.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
And here I'm going to say Budapest for example.

07:07.570 --> 07:12.890
And now once somebody presses the button I also want to changed number that is displayed in there.

07:13.000 --> 07:21.640
So here I I again need to use qued widgets that queue table widget item and then enter the value.

07:21.640 --> 07:29.680
Now the value that it expects as it can see queue table widget item and string queue icon or queue table

07:29.680 --> 07:35.590
widget items so you can enter multiple different versions in here so I'm just going to say something

07:35.710 --> 07:37.150
like a number.

07:37.180 --> 07:41.800
So I'm just going to enter a string as a number or a number as a string.

07:41.800 --> 07:44.040
That's pretty much the way around.

07:44.260 --> 07:51.890
OK so if I run that now and I execute my partner you can see now changed the value.

07:52.200 --> 08:00.710
So now we went to Budapest and it changed the value of the inhabitants as well as easy as that.

08:00.710 --> 08:06.390
So now you know how you can actually change values based on a button click.

08:06.390 --> 08:08.830
So what does the said item do in general.

08:08.850 --> 08:14.550
Well we want to change the table widget that we have and we want to set a particular item that we need

08:14.550 --> 08:19.510
to tell and which row and which column we want to change something.

08:19.560 --> 08:25.950
And if you want to know which order it is then you can always just call the method and it will help

08:25.950 --> 08:26.370
you out.

08:26.370 --> 08:32.230
So said Eitan entered something and you can see it starts with the row.

08:32.430 --> 08:35.020
So zeroed the comma zero.

08:35.040 --> 08:42.100
So row column and then it needs to Q2 which are at or Q table widget item here.

08:42.450 --> 08:43.150
OK.

08:43.440 --> 08:48.890
So we have the row then the column then we have the items so pretty much the entry of it.

08:48.900 --> 08:54.890
And then you saw that these can be either numbered can be a string or can be and I can something like

08:54.900 --> 09:02.600
that in order to in general even get a click button to do something or a button to do something.

09:02.790 --> 09:04.650
We need to connect it.

09:04.710 --> 09:09.570
So you see we had this button that we wanted to connect to something.

09:09.780 --> 09:15.380
Then we said which event that should be so the click events are when somebody clicks on it and we connected

09:15.380 --> 09:22.140
it to a specific method and we need to only pass the method name and not a method call in here.

09:22.300 --> 09:27.720
And then we can just define whatever should happen once this button is pressed or once this method is

09:27.720 --> 09:28.240
called.

09:28.410 --> 09:30.390
And he will just change our table.

09:30.780 --> 09:40.590
All right so I'd say we check out how to add an additional row here in the next video when pressing

09:40.590 --> 09:44.600
the button we want to add a row and then we want to be able to enter data in there.

09:44.610 --> 09:46.620
So that's what we're going to check out in the next video.

09:46.680 --> 09:47.800
So see you there.
