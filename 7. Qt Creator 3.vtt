00:00.430 --> 00:01.190
We'll come back.

00:01.220 --> 00:05.640
And I would like to talk to you about but lay out that we have.

00:05.640 --> 00:12.000
So we want to play out options and I showed you those real quickly but I didn't go into too much detail.

00:12.010 --> 00:16.870
So let's go ahead and use for example a horizontal layout.

00:16.870 --> 00:22.590
So I'm just going to say OK here I want to have a horizontal lay out what that does is it pretty much

00:23.190 --> 00:25.120
puts elements next to each other.

00:25.140 --> 00:29.020
So I'm just going to add a radio button in here as well.

00:29.060 --> 00:33.320
So you see now it created this radio button next to the push button.

00:33.550 --> 00:37.390
And if I tried to move it it moves pretty much the whole thing.

00:37.590 --> 00:39.730
That's because the horizontal layout is selected.

00:39.720 --> 00:44.120
But now if I move the button next to the radio button is still working.

00:44.220 --> 00:44.810
OK.

00:45.030 --> 00:49.550
So if you select something and drag it you can see it in the hierarchy on the right hand side.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.600
So it says horizontal layout is selected.

00:51.600 --> 00:56.640
That's why I'm selecting the whole horizontal layout even though I would like to drag the button so

00:56.640 --> 01:01.150
I would need to push the button specifically in order to drag around the button.

01:01.400 --> 01:01.800
All right.

01:01.800 --> 01:08.610
So let's say I don't want to put stuff on top of each other then I would use the vertical layout so

01:08.610 --> 01:14.250
I'm just going to create a little vertical lay out here and say like this and then I just drag some

01:14.250 --> 01:22.800
buttons in there and they all just have this very basic appeal.

01:23.010 --> 01:26.800
Now this will make this a little smaller as well.

01:27.240 --> 01:31.440
And then we have this grid layout so let's drag it greatly out in here I'm going to make it a little

01:31.440 --> 01:37.830
bigger in here I'm also going to just drag in some buttons as you can see it applies them on top of

01:37.830 --> 01:43.470
each other except I want to put it next to each other so you can create I see that it creates a grid

01:43.500 --> 01:44.780
automatically for me.

01:45.330 --> 01:52.040
And I have a push button here and now we have this form layout which is pretty much perfect to create

01:52.050 --> 01:52.710
forms.

01:52.740 --> 01:55.770
So let's check that out.

01:56.250 --> 02:00.540
And I'm going to drag stuff a little up.

02:00.820 --> 02:06.300
Now in this forum lay out this is where you would put for example a label.

02:07.050 --> 02:10.910
Then you would have a text field next to it.

02:10.920 --> 02:17.310
So let me get a line edit here and do the same thing once again.

02:17.400 --> 02:24.240
So create another label and another line added I can see now it knows perfectly what to do what to do.

02:24.240 --> 02:30.030
So it creates the form or the label is on the left the text added is on the right.

02:30.240 --> 02:38.070
And I'd say this looks pretty good but now let's see how it looks in our actual UI.

02:38.070 --> 02:41.880
So I'm going to save this and go back to my bill.

02:41.940 --> 02:42.330
Why.

02:42.360 --> 02:49.390
So I'm going to run the bill why in order to make sure that my main window Y is updated.

02:49.770 --> 02:55.980
And now you will see that we have a horizontal layout was contains all of the different elements and

02:55.980 --> 02:59.190
then we have the vertical layout and so forth.

02:59.190 --> 03:06.400
All right so now I'm going to run the main the Y file in order to get my UI.

03:06.570 --> 03:07.920
So you see it's pretty clean.

03:07.920 --> 03:09.540
It's very good.

03:09.540 --> 03:16.390
Things are structured in a way where I would say OK this is all right but now let's look at this.

03:16.500 --> 03:25.050
You see if I changed the size of the window suddenly my elements disappear and that's not exactly what

03:25.050 --> 03:27.650
I would want to my UI to do.

03:27.930 --> 03:29.970
OK so how do I fix them.

03:30.060 --> 03:31.740
How do I solve this problem.

03:31.740 --> 03:39.680
Well let's go back to the cute creator and in here you can select the central widget or the main window.

03:39.870 --> 03:42.700
So let's go to the central widget and select that one.

03:42.750 --> 03:44.250
It's important that it's selected.

03:44.400 --> 03:47.240
Then you can use those buttons that you have here at the top.

03:47.520 --> 03:52.280
And they're a little smaller even though they increased the size of the UI but still get this problem.

03:52.280 --> 03:56.130
So there's this one which says that lay out in a grid.

03:56.430 --> 04:04.500
So I'm just going to say like lay out in a grid and as you can see suddenly all the elements are changed

04:04.530 --> 04:05.730
in their size.

04:05.730 --> 04:09.350
So this push button is a lot thicker.

04:09.490 --> 04:16.440
We're Weider pretty much just push button here is going almost through the whole width of the page and

04:16.560 --> 04:23.970
the same goes for all the other elements so they are now positioned in a grid so that we cannot change

04:24.030 --> 04:26.640
and not change to size anymore.

04:26.640 --> 04:37.110
So I would like to for example actually put this back when I would like to change to size.

04:37.680 --> 04:39.770
Let me make it a little smaller.

04:40.530 --> 04:47.060
And as you can see it goes back jumps back to the value that it has defined for me.

04:47.070 --> 04:55.110
So now in order to test that I'm going to save it again go back here run my bill.

04:55.160 --> 04:55.610
Why.

04:55.660 --> 05:01.560
So just to like build here and then after that's done run my main paper why.

05:02.350 --> 05:06.540
And you will see that that's how my solution looks like now.

05:06.550 --> 05:16.540
So now even if I change the size of my UI you can see everything is still fitting perfectly OK.

05:16.540 --> 05:23.740
So that's pretty much what you can do with this approach you can see I cannot make it thinner than this

05:23.740 --> 05:24.460
minimum here.

05:24.460 --> 05:28.260
I can not make it shorter than the minimum.

05:28.300 --> 05:32.130
So that's pretty much what this feature does for me.

05:32.980 --> 05:34.990
So let me go back to cute.

05:35.110 --> 05:41.350
Now if you want to use a different layout you can do that here lay out in the form lay out lay out in

05:41.350 --> 05:43.320
the vertical and splitter.

05:43.420 --> 05:48.580
But the one that is really good is to lay out in a grid word pretty does what we've just seen.

05:48.610 --> 05:54.760
Now what if you want to have a little distance in between here which you then can use is a spacer.

05:54.760 --> 06:00.330
So for example you could use a vertical spacer in between here you see now create that this space or

06:00.340 --> 06:04.710
for me but I cannot change the size of the spacer either.

06:04.750 --> 06:10.930
Let me save that and build real quickly run the build and it's done.

06:10.930 --> 06:13.300
Run the main and there we are.

06:13.300 --> 06:19.570
So there is a space in between but the space now is depending on the size of the window.

06:19.900 --> 06:24.970
So if you want to have a distance in between here you can get that but it's going to be flexible at

06:24.970 --> 06:27.580
least with this layout.

06:27.580 --> 06:28.340
All right.

06:28.630 --> 06:34.570
So one thing that you have to take into consideration when pressing this button here at the top is that

06:34.570 --> 06:39.880
you have your central widget or your main window selected in order to do that.

06:39.880 --> 06:42.850
Now what you can of course do is any time break to lay out.

06:42.850 --> 06:47.590
So let me break the latest as additional button here and it will pretty much break the whole layout

06:47.620 --> 06:50.590
and pull things and a different way.

06:50.790 --> 06:51.330
OK.

06:51.550 --> 06:59.020
So if I go back to my layout grid can see it goes back to my structure that looked pretty good.

06:59.050 --> 06:59.770
All right.

06:59.770 --> 07:01.870
So that was just something that I wanted to show you.

07:01.900 --> 07:07.760
And I'd say let's go to signals and slots in the next video.
