00:02.310 --> 00:02.950
Welcome back.

00:02.970 --> 00:06.240
In this video we are going to read this as we file first.

00:06.390 --> 00:11.270
And before we do so I would like to do one little thing and I would like to get rid of the zero and

00:11.260 --> 00:11.970
one.

00:12.120 --> 00:18.800
And in order to do so I just need to get rid of this vertical head visible so I can uncheck this.

00:18.990 --> 00:20.790
And as you can see now it's gone.

00:20.790 --> 00:21.230
All right.

00:21.240 --> 00:26.100
Now it's not this not appearing anymore so I'm going to save this main window right UI.

00:26.260 --> 00:33.900
Then I go back to my pirate charm and I rebuild my build why I recompiled my build so that I can now

00:33.900 --> 00:34.790
work with it.

00:35.070 --> 00:38.890
And then I get rid of all of this code that I have added.

00:39.270 --> 00:44.510
So the only thing I have is my main window with its constructor why I set the titles to two student

00:44.520 --> 00:45.510
manager.

00:45.690 --> 00:49.020
Now the next thing I want to do is to read these v files.

00:49.020 --> 00:56.670
I'm just going to say self-taught read C as the file and then I tell it which file I want to read.

00:56.670 --> 01:02.220
And I called this file students Dotsie as Veep and now you might wonder where is this retaught or read

01:02.220 --> 01:04.730
C S V file method coming from.

01:04.800 --> 01:06.650
Well it's not coming from ourselves.

01:06.660 --> 01:09.860
We need to develop it of course we need to implement it.

01:09.870 --> 01:18.150
So I'm going to write C S V file and it requires one pair of Meecher in a declaration which I'm going

01:18.150 --> 01:19.690
to call file name.

01:19.950 --> 01:25.920
OK so I want to open up the file name and what I want to do is I want to read through the students use

01:25.930 --> 01:30.960
the file and read every single row in here into our program.

01:31.200 --> 01:32.390
And how would I do that.

01:32.550 --> 01:36.840
Well the best way is to actually use the c as we import.

01:36.870 --> 01:44.130
So we can just check out the documentation once again where we are this module called C as V and it

01:44.130 --> 01:48.310
contains this reader method which we can very easily use.

01:48.310 --> 01:54.540
I'm just going to copy this code from here as we have done in the past on getting the right reader because

01:54.540 --> 01:56.180
I want to read for now.

01:56.340 --> 02:02.240
And instead of passing I'm just going to say OK open a file and then read.

02:02.490 --> 02:10.210
And of course I need to be careful with the right indentation so I'm going to take care of that.

02:10.440 --> 02:15.580
Now it says here C's is missing so I need to import C S V.

02:15.640 --> 02:16.660
Let's do that.

02:16.660 --> 02:18.790
Import C as V.

02:19.560 --> 02:22.850
Now I don't want to open agues.

02:23.000 --> 02:23.650
C S V.

02:23.660 --> 02:25.650
I actually want to open my file name.

02:25.680 --> 02:32.590
So I'm going to say file name and the way I want to open it is I want to read it.

02:32.590 --> 02:35.230
So I'm just going to say are now.

02:35.300 --> 02:37.020
The rest can stay the same.

02:37.020 --> 02:38.880
This should be called file.

02:38.890 --> 02:40.590
At least that's my preference.

02:40.590 --> 02:43.430
You could of course leave it as file name.

02:43.630 --> 02:47.640
Then I will not going to call it spam reader because we're not reading spam.

02:47.640 --> 02:49.650
We're just calling in reader.

02:49.740 --> 02:56.730
So I renamed it and the delimiter as we can see here is not an empty space but it's actually a comma

02:57.270 --> 03:03.750
so we need to replace this empty space with a comma and the quote character.

03:03.900 --> 03:09.720
Well we don't have a quote character yet but if somebody would ever enter something like informatics

03:09.720 --> 03:17.640
like this then we could say OK we are going to use to quote Tayshaun mark as a core character.

03:17.640 --> 03:21.950
Now Forro in reader Prince John wrote.

03:21.960 --> 03:27.910
Well I'm just going to say print the roll because I just want to see the role for now.

03:28.180 --> 03:36.360
OK now if we run our main W-why file then we should see the file C as the file read already.

03:36.360 --> 03:43.680
So because you can see it's read and we can see here Jondo informatics is one list of strings.

03:43.740 --> 03:46.550
Then there's the next list of strings and so forth.

03:46.560 --> 03:53.970
So reading already works but now we also want to display that correctly in our table because if we look

03:53.970 --> 03:57.310
at our table nothing has changed we still have Jondo informatics.

03:57.310 --> 04:00.230
Erica Fisher mathematics but.

04:00.270 --> 04:01.520
Or mathematics.

04:01.560 --> 04:02.660
That's even better.

04:02.670 --> 04:12.540
So her name is as subject to mathematics and we need to pretty much take care of adding data in there.

04:12.540 --> 04:17.270
And as you recall probably we had this set item method.

04:17.340 --> 04:24.120
So what I'm going to do here is instead of just printing the row I'm going to say the line is equal

04:24.120 --> 04:25.770
to self aren't you.

04:25.770 --> 04:39.330
I teach students table third row count and at that point you might say OK line is not a good name for

04:39.420 --> 04:40.690
the row count.

04:41.040 --> 04:43.720
Maybe we should call this row count here.

04:43.740 --> 04:49.010
Row count is going to be self taught students table row count.

04:49.110 --> 04:51.400
Now why would we need that.

04:51.450 --> 04:58.560
Well we need that in order to be able to insert rows because as you know we had this insert row method

04:58.890 --> 05:02.360
which pretty much allows us to insert a row at a specific position.

05:02.510 --> 05:09.200
So I'm just going to say insert your row onto the students table so self but you are students table

05:09.500 --> 05:17.180
which is the students table that we have in our whole UI which pretty much is this table here is a table

05:17.960 --> 05:21.350
and there insert a row.

05:21.680 --> 05:24.570
And where should we inserted add row count.

05:24.650 --> 05:29.520
Now let's save that and test it once again and see OK there we are.

05:29.570 --> 05:35.450
So as you can see we have suddenly four additional rows and of course they are empty because we didn't

05:35.480 --> 05:37.560
tell those rows.

05:37.570 --> 05:45.050
What an entry should have what content they should have and that's what we are going to add now so in

05:45.050 --> 05:56.150
here we're just going to say self-taught you find our students table set items and what is the item.

05:56.150 --> 06:01.240
Well it's our row count comma.

06:01.490 --> 06:02.870
Then the column.

06:03.290 --> 06:09.440
And here we are we can specify directly because we know in the column zero we have the first name in

06:09.440 --> 06:13.320
column 1 we have the last name and then column 2 we have the subject or the major.

06:13.550 --> 06:23.720
So I'm just going to say cute widgets that cute table widget item because that's the type that we require

06:23.720 --> 06:31.730
here and in here I can just enter the text so I can enter something like text with just see if that

06:31.730 --> 06:32.280
works.

06:32.330 --> 06:35.040
And we should see that here we have text text text text.

06:35.060 --> 06:35.460
OK.

06:35.480 --> 06:36.890
So that seems to work.

06:36.890 --> 06:39.750
Now we can replace it with the actual entry.

06:39.890 --> 06:41.970
So where do we get the entry from.

06:42.290 --> 06:47.500
From our row which is pretty much that and 30 here.

06:47.550 --> 06:50.410
So we see row zero as the first name.

06:50.440 --> 06:54.860
Row one is dough and row 2 is the subject.

06:55.040 --> 07:04.520
So what we can just say is row at position zero should be here and now can do the same thing for the

07:04.520 --> 07:09.020
other two because we also have the last name.

07:09.230 --> 07:15.870
And we also have the subject so you can just replace those values here.

07:15.890 --> 07:20.070
This is going to be the last name that line here.

07:20.070 --> 07:24.880
And this is going to be the subject because as you see row at position zero.

07:24.880 --> 07:29.600
Look at it as informatics mathematics informatics and mathematics.

07:30.060 --> 07:31.550
So now let's run it again.

07:31.740 --> 07:40.270
And there we are so Jondo informatics Michael Moore mathematics Jondo 3 or John 3 3 informatics.

07:40.290 --> 07:47.820
So now we also have this girl Erica Fisher whose name is or whose subject is mathematics.

07:47.820 --> 07:50.610
So I would really like to know what mathematics is.

07:50.860 --> 07:54.070
But mathematics is actually what I wanted to enter there.

07:54.320 --> 07:55.060
OK.

07:55.200 --> 08:01.800
So by this point you can see we can very easily read the data from a c v file and we can very easily

08:01.800 --> 08:05.520
display it in our table here.

08:05.520 --> 08:07.800
So that's already pretty powerful and very cool.

08:07.800 --> 08:10.060
Now of course we want to add new entries.

08:10.200 --> 08:12.580
So we need to implement that functionality.

08:12.750 --> 08:15.430
And later we need to save the entries as well.

08:15.540 --> 08:20.180
So I'd say let's have a look at creating a new entry in the next video.

08:20.190 --> 08:21.370
So see you there.
