00:02.000 --> 00:07.430
Already what come back in this video we are going to check out finding elements and we have already

00:07.430 --> 00:08.620
seen how to find elements.

00:08.630 --> 00:14.930
But now we're going to use it with this particular example that we had where we had these blocks here

00:15.230 --> 00:22.370
which are very similar all the time and now a little tip on how to crawl a Web site efficiently is first

00:22.370 --> 00:24.450
of all find out what you want to crawl.

00:24.470 --> 00:30.680
Because most of the time you would like to or you will want to crawl something that is from a specific

00:31.100 --> 00:35.280
structure or has a specific structure and is repeatedly on that website.

00:35.540 --> 00:40.280
At least most of the time that would be the case so you can now either view the page source as we have

00:40.280 --> 00:46.460
done already but then that's a little difficult to figure out where which part of the website is.

00:46.550 --> 00:54.260
Another great tool is to inspect the websites so when you click inspect and now you can see that the

00:54.260 --> 00:57.350
body now colors everything black blue.

00:57.350 --> 00:59.670
So if I go over this body everything is blue.

00:59.670 --> 01:06.530
Now I can go into the container and there I have ro content OK that seems like what I want.

01:06.530 --> 01:10.960
And there is this call LG 12 ok and then I'll check it out.

01:10.970 --> 01:15.130
And as you can see here now we have this card card card card.

01:15.140 --> 01:19.710
So we have all of these cards so there's this defect with the classic card.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.910
And that's this first block.

01:21.950 --> 01:24.590
Then the second one the third one and so forth.

01:24.590 --> 01:33.340
And they contain information so this card has a card block which has a an A which contains a image.

01:33.440 --> 01:37.960
So there is an image and there that's the image that we're talking about.

01:38.210 --> 01:44.790
And this little sign that we have here with this little icon the smiley.

01:44.870 --> 01:52.640
Then we have a card title which is contained code containing this emoji and a span polarized modular

01:52.910 --> 01:54.980
conglomeration and so forth.

01:54.980 --> 02:02.720
So what you also can do is just copy something that you have in the website like a title or something.

02:02.720 --> 02:11.950
One little piece of what you want to crawl and then you simply search for it in your source code.

02:12.080 --> 02:19.640
So here you just enter that and you see OK it's within this div tag which was called or which has this

02:19.640 --> 02:23.950
class card block and there is disband polarized modular conglomeration.

02:24.140 --> 02:27.120
And then you see OK that's the one that I'm looking for.

02:27.560 --> 02:32.680
And you also of course can look it up here where you see OK that C-SPAN that I'm looking at.

02:32.870 --> 02:40.760
And then we have this card text which is whilom just some more information on whatever this article

02:40.760 --> 02:41.360
could be.

02:41.360 --> 02:48.100
So this could be a front page with articles and if you click in on them you get to the details where

02:48.110 --> 02:50.930
you can read the whole article or something like that.

02:50.930 --> 02:56.730
All right so let's go ahead and use that knowledge in order to crawl through it.

02:56.750 --> 02:59.710
And so we want to find elements in there.

02:59.720 --> 03:04.620
So we have this document and now let's first of all print the doc.

03:04.930 --> 03:06.900
So print doc just to see.

03:06.920 --> 03:10.420
Well of course you need to run all the other code first.

03:10.550 --> 03:10.940
OK.

03:10.940 --> 03:11.840
There we are.

03:11.840 --> 03:14.420
So now you can see the whole document has been printed.

03:14.660 --> 03:20.660
Well now what we can do is of course only select certain aspects of it and that's the beauty about beautiful

03:20.660 --> 03:21.680
soup.

03:21.680 --> 03:25.660
So we can just say select and what do we select here.

03:25.670 --> 03:28.280
Well we will see red card white card.

03:28.460 --> 03:32.080
Well if we look at it it's always this card class here.

03:32.150 --> 03:38.140
And as you might remember from the last video whenever we were using classes we searched for the dot.

03:38.230 --> 03:41.300
So dog cart will be the correct one.

03:41.300 --> 03:43.890
So that's why I'm searching for dog cart.

03:43.910 --> 03:52.620
And now let me run that code and as you can see I'm getting this list of entries.

03:52.710 --> 03:57.960
So there this def class card with a diff class card block.

03:57.960 --> 04:07.430
Then we have the A which is a link an image a an H for which is a title and so forth.

04:07.620 --> 04:12.950
And then we have the second entry and it starts here.

04:12.960 --> 04:16.960
So this is the second entry as it can separated by a comma.

04:17.130 --> 04:20.170
So this part is the first element.

04:20.190 --> 04:23.270
Then we have the second element goes up to here.

04:23.460 --> 04:27.180
Third goes up to here and so forth.

04:27.620 --> 04:33.410
Now as you can see there's always this emoji which is within the class emoji.

04:33.600 --> 04:36.610
So we could even go through all of the Modise.

04:36.750 --> 04:45.810
So if you just say something like that in MO G you will see spin class emoji and all of the smileys

04:46.710 --> 04:48.220
or DC moujiks.

04:48.810 --> 04:55.390
So how do I get the emoji itself because Saverne DMM selecting the whole span as you can see.

04:55.470 --> 05:01.030
So I'm selecting the object or the tag that contains the class and Moji.

05:01.170 --> 05:06.690
And that's why it's given gives me this spen with the first one and so forth so it gives me a list of

05:06.690 --> 05:07.980
all of them.

05:08.070 --> 05:12.550
So let's use a different approach where we get the information in a different manner.

05:12.600 --> 05:21.280
So let's say I'm using a for loop here to go through my dog that selects and I want to select cards

05:21.330 --> 05:24.580
so I was selected by card as we did before.

05:24.900 --> 05:30.510
But now I'm going to store the emoji in a variable and where can I find it.

05:30.510 --> 05:37.940
What I can find within a specific cart and I can select one Moji.

05:38.640 --> 05:39.650
So why is that.

05:39.660 --> 05:42.680
And here we have to use a more g.

05:43.530 --> 05:49.530
And from that if we run that nothing much happens if we get the text.

05:49.570 --> 05:58.270
Again nothing much happens but we can print the Margie's now so we can just print Moji.

05:58.510 --> 06:02.220
Now as you can see now I'm getting all of the Modise.

06:02.220 --> 06:09.450
So what I did here is I use a for loop to go through all the cards that we have in our document.

06:09.450 --> 06:17.370
So all the different with a card class and I used this card object in order to check through it or discard

06:17.370 --> 06:18.320
variable.

06:18.330 --> 06:26.250
And from that specific card that I'm looking at I selected only one element that had the class emoji.

06:26.250 --> 06:33.240
And I took the actual text because if I wouldn't have done that so if I run it like this you see I get

06:33.240 --> 06:36.780
this whole span but I only want to have the content of it.

06:36.780 --> 06:41.220
I only want to have the text so that's why I'm saying OK give me the text on it.

06:41.370 --> 06:47.240
And there we are we only get the Modise and we'll get them in a single line all the time.

06:47.280 --> 06:51.070
That's because we printed with this print statement here.

06:51.090 --> 06:53.750
All right so now you know how to get the Moji.

06:53.910 --> 06:59.720
What if I was so want to get the title or else I want to get the content and so forth.

06:59.940 --> 07:10.150
Well then I can go ahead and use a constant variable and I check only one again.

07:10.260 --> 07:11.510
I go through the card.

07:11.570 --> 07:14.340
I check the card and I select only one.

07:14.340 --> 07:15.940
And what shall I select.

07:15.960 --> 07:16.970
Well let's check it out.

07:16.980 --> 07:19.600
Let's have a look at our website again.

07:19.860 --> 07:24.550
So I would like to have the content and the content is this piece right here.

07:24.720 --> 07:32.460
So if I go to this P-TECH as you can see it says class card mine is text OK and I would like to have

07:32.460 --> 07:34.160
this content right there.

07:34.410 --> 07:35.940
So let's use it.

07:36.180 --> 07:41.250
Let's use this knowledge and search for card minus text.

07:41.490 --> 07:48.750
And of course this has to be within quotation marks because we're handing over a string.

07:49.200 --> 07:51.140
And from that I would like to have the text.

07:51.180 --> 07:54.240
Now let's print the content as well.

07:54.240 --> 07:54.880
And there we are.

07:54.880 --> 07:59.220
So now we're printing the content of every single one of them in order to keep it clean.

07:59.220 --> 08:05.370
I'm just going to say break for now because I I want to only have one entry in a correct manner for

08:05.370 --> 08:05.880
now.

08:06.090 --> 08:10.160
So as you can see I already have the icon I have the counter.

08:10.170 --> 08:14.500
Now let's also get the titles so I would like to print a title on it as well.

08:14.880 --> 08:16.800
Well how do we do that.

08:17.070 --> 08:24.430
Well we get the title and if we look at the title.

08:24.690 --> 08:26.100
So let's go ahead.

08:26.100 --> 08:26.910
Where's the title.

08:26.910 --> 08:30.090
So we have this classic card title.

08:30.420 --> 08:31.710
But then there are two Spens.

08:31.710 --> 08:34.460
So there is this once banker with the class emoji.

08:34.560 --> 08:38.720
And then there is another span which is polarized modulo conglomeration.

08:38.760 --> 08:43.560
In this example but it doesn't have a class so the title doesn't actually have a class.

08:43.640 --> 08:49.540
It's within this age for tag which has the card title but there is another spanne which is our emoji.

08:49.690 --> 08:51.270
So how do we handle that.

08:51.490 --> 09:00.680
Well let's just say we call this thing title Spens and we go to select and some we don't select the

09:00.700 --> 09:09.190
one but we're selecting the cart minus title Spen.

09:09.780 --> 09:14.700
And now let's print that title span as well.

09:15.730 --> 09:18.830
Or title Spens as well.

09:18.970 --> 09:26.520
And for now as you can see we get this whole span containing the Moji and text here.

09:26.530 --> 09:30.090
So how do I get only this spen how.

09:30.340 --> 09:33.480
Well if we look at it this is a list.

09:33.610 --> 09:37.000
And how do we access a particular element of a list.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.990
Well we just say okay this is zero and that is index 1.

09:42.010 --> 09:50.290
So what we can do now here is say OK I would like to have index one and in particular if we run that

09:50.350 --> 09:52.670
we get this span surrounding it again.

09:52.870 --> 09:59.110
In particular I would like to get the text so I run that now as you can see now I'm getting the title

09:59.350 --> 10:02.190
which is this polarized modular conglomerate.

10:02.710 --> 10:07.120
And if I don't break it if I run it through it for all of them as you can see I'm getting it for all

10:07.120 --> 10:11.920
of the titles and all of the contents and stuff like that.

10:11.950 --> 10:14.350
So let me had the break again.

10:14.920 --> 10:22.180
So in order to keep things clean let's also create a title variable because we had title span's which

10:22.180 --> 10:31.600
contains both Spens which was the icon or the smiley or emoji and the title has a span but let's just

10:31.600 --> 10:34.830
say it's stored as a title and what should be in there.

10:34.840 --> 10:37.670
Well simply that content here.

10:37.930 --> 10:43.810
And then we can of course print the title now so as you can see we still get the same result but we

10:43.810 --> 10:47.860
have it stored in a variable as we did with the emoji and with the content.

10:47.860 --> 10:52.200
So now we have all of those contents or information already.

10:52.790 --> 10:58.540
And a very good way I'd say in a very good structured way.

10:58.540 --> 11:06.160
All right so finally if we look at one of those articles let's say of these blocks here we have an image

11:06.670 --> 11:08.340
and how do I get this image.

11:08.500 --> 11:16.120
Well first of all let's look at where the image is and it is within a page it stands for link.

11:16.150 --> 11:20.650
Or you can click on it and it opens up a link as you can see for hyperlink.

11:20.900 --> 11:28.050
Not precisely I would say a CH is an hyperlink but the thing is age is already for headlines.

11:28.090 --> 11:37.060
So we have this class called in this case I am responsive flowed right.

11:37.070 --> 11:42.530
And then there is the source and the source is R C is actually what we want so we would like to have

11:42.530 --> 11:46.390
the source of the image so that we can parse the link.

11:46.400 --> 11:48.980
So that's pretty much the link to the image.

11:49.250 --> 11:50.860
And how do we get that.

11:51.170 --> 11:58.520
Well first of all let's go back to our code and create a new variable and by the way I'm going to clean

11:58.520 --> 12:00.220
it up a little bit here.

12:00.250 --> 12:04.310
I'm going to have the variables before I do print them.

12:04.310 --> 12:04.870
So.

12:05.090 --> 12:08.380
All right so now I have the Moji the content title span.

12:08.420 --> 12:10.940
And from that I get the title.

12:10.970 --> 12:14.500
And before we look at the image we can even shorten things up.

12:14.500 --> 12:19.090
So currently we say title spans card select and so forth.

12:19.100 --> 12:26.420
And then we take title spent at position 1 or at index 1 and instead of doing that we can even just

12:26.420 --> 12:31.940
take that code straight away and replace title Spens with it.

12:32.210 --> 12:34.710
So that will pretty much do the same thing.

12:34.760 --> 12:40.400
But we have it in one line so I would just say OK the title is going to be carded select and where we

12:40.400 --> 12:45.760
have the card title span text so let's run that again and see whether we still get that title.

12:45.770 --> 12:47.500
And yes we do.

12:47.780 --> 12:54.440
All right so now that that is working let's get the image in in order to get the image we are going

12:54.440 --> 13:02.600
to use cart dot select underscore one because we only want to select one and only one of them and it's

13:02.600 --> 13:03.530
only containing 1.

13:03.530 --> 13:04.340
So that's a good thing.

13:04.340 --> 13:06.650
So each article only has one image.

13:06.680 --> 13:11.470
That way we can use this method instead of the Select method.

13:11.690 --> 13:14.000
And what do we want to have.

13:14.030 --> 13:17.520
Well we would like to have the i n g and y is a d m g.

13:17.530 --> 13:27.140
Well if you look at it this whole block here does card block contains an A tag here with a Tref which

13:27.140 --> 13:28.200
is to link to the image.

13:28.220 --> 13:31.160
But then the actual image itself is this one here.

13:31.160 --> 13:40.060
So this tag here where you can see it has multiple attributes like a class attribute and SIRC a to a

13:40.070 --> 13:42.550
height attribute and so forth.

13:42.560 --> 13:50.530
So now in order to access the attributes we can use the following You can use print image dot 80 are

13:50.590 --> 13:54.810
as that's or just print out the ACARS for now.

13:54.830 --> 13:56.430
So as you can see these are the attributes.

13:56.450 --> 14:01.850
And you also can see that they are given in the format of a dictionary.

14:01.940 --> 14:08.150
We have all of these attributes like this class here which is the key and the value is this list here.

14:08.210 --> 14:13.840
Then we have the S R C which is the key and the value is this link here.

14:13.850 --> 14:19.790
So it's pretty much a link which says OK in the root folder there is an image folder where we have a

14:19.790 --> 14:20.940
file called one.

14:20.980 --> 14:25.210
Jay Peck or Jay PGE and that's the one we would like to access here.

14:25.550 --> 14:35.390
So in order to get the S R C we need to use square brackets because if we want to access an entry within

14:35.870 --> 14:38.910
a dictionary we use square brackets as you might recall.

14:38.960 --> 14:44.550
And then we need to enter the key name and the key name here is S R C so that's the key name here.

14:44.750 --> 14:49.060
And if we print that out we can see that that is pretty much what we want.

14:49.190 --> 14:55.250
Now of course we want to store that in the image and not just that part that we have here.

14:55.250 --> 15:00.690
So what we can do is simply say OK use dot HPR S..

15:00.710 --> 15:02.320
And now let's just print out image.

15:02.330 --> 15:07.730
And if I run that code Well we pretty much get the same thing but now the right information is stored

15:07.760 --> 15:12.770
within the image because we didn't want to get all of the information from that.

15:12.800 --> 15:17.210
I am g but we actually wanted to get the source information.

15:17.450 --> 15:20.590
Yeah that's pretty much what we did here and that's it.

15:20.590 --> 15:23.250
So now we have all of the information.

15:23.260 --> 15:27.590
Now we just need to bring it into the right format and display accordingly.

15:27.590 --> 15:32.980
And in the next video we are going to check out how we can use object oriented programming here to make

15:32.980 --> 15:38.340
our life a lot easier and to make our program a lot better and more readable.

15:38.350 --> 15:39.460
So see you there.
