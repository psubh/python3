WEBVTT

00:00.450 --> 00:01.210
Welcome back.

00:01.230 --> 00:08.190
Now that cutesie is installed we can go ahead and use pi charm in order to use cute and in order to

00:08.220 --> 00:10.710
go ahead and use that we are going to create a new project.

00:10.710 --> 00:13.880
So open up pie chart and create a new project.

00:13.890 --> 00:19.760
Now here we need to change a project interpreter because we don't want to create a virtual environment.

00:19.770 --> 00:22.230
What we want to use an existing interpreter

00:25.230 --> 00:27.990
and here we of course need to select a interpreter.

00:27.990 --> 00:33.630
So I'm going to press the three dots and I'm going to use the Conder and

00:36.700 --> 00:44.330
I'm going to go to Kondo environment and then select a interpreter and that will be my python file.

00:44.340 --> 00:51.770
So I need to go to users then to Anaconda where actually to my user than to Anaconda free and in there

00:52.340 --> 00:57.240
I have a python file which is called Python paksa.

00:57.380 --> 00:59.720
So that's the one that I want to use.

01:00.050 --> 01:05.410
So I select that one and press OK as you can see now pipe 3.6.

01:05.420 --> 01:08.500
In my case is the interpreter that is selected.

01:08.540 --> 01:10.120
Of course I need to give it a name.

01:10.130 --> 01:20.600
My application here and I'm going to call that student manager and press create once I'm here I'm going

01:20.600 --> 01:24.350
to wait a little bit until everything is ready.

01:24.830 --> 01:30.680
And once that is ready we can go ahead and create a new file so I'm going to create a new python file

01:31.010 --> 01:32.630
which I'm just going to call maned up.

01:32.690 --> 01:33.670
Why.

01:34.160 --> 01:35.260
And there we are.

01:35.390 --> 01:38.680
So in here I need to import Ciss first.

01:38.730 --> 01:43.540
A system library and then from Q-tip.

01:43.610 --> 01:49.250
Why I want to import cutesie widgets or qued would git.

01:49.430 --> 01:56.780
So here you see that it offers me these cute widgets to here which is on their library's side pages

01:57.170 --> 01:57.950
and then Q-tip.

01:57.950 --> 01:58.640
Why.

01:58.970 --> 02:00.790
And if it doesn't help you out.

02:00.830 --> 02:08.600
So if you enter something and this intelligence doesn't come up and you can press control space or command

02:08.600 --> 02:10.910
space and that will open up.

02:10.910 --> 02:17.720
So I'm just going to go for cutesie widgets because we want to use widgets now in order to create an

02:17.720 --> 02:23.280
app I need to say OK open up a web app and it should be a cutey widgets dot.

02:23.330 --> 02:25.970
Q app location.

02:26.060 --> 02:31.580
So queue application which pretty much creates a widget application.

02:31.580 --> 02:37.550
Now this application needs some information so it could take in an argument as soon as you can see here

02:37.550 --> 02:39.980
it says RGV list of string.

02:39.980 --> 02:47.900
So it requires a perimeter here and to permuted and I'm going to give it is says Dot RGV.

02:47.900 --> 02:53.840
Now this could be something like droite dragging a file onto our python file or stuff like that.

02:53.840 --> 03:01.300
And as we don't do that we still need to give it some sort of a paramita here which is of this type

03:01.310 --> 03:08.060
so needs to have this argument vees And once we have that we can create a window as you know a application

03:08.060 --> 03:14.490
can contain multiple windows and we can just go ahead and create one window by using cutesie widgets

03:14.510 --> 03:16.610
dot main window.

03:16.610 --> 03:24.470
So Q T or Q main window and here were pretty much already creating a window.

03:24.470 --> 03:32.610
So what we can do is show this window so window don't show and as you can see it's going to show self.

03:32.690 --> 03:41.030
So if we execute this code now and we save it and right click Run main that will open up and it will

03:41.030 --> 03:42.520
close straight away.

03:42.620 --> 03:45.870
So as you can see I close my application it opened up real quickly.

03:46.040 --> 03:52.560
Run main There is this little window and it's gone like in the South Park episode and it's gone.

03:52.880 --> 03:59.360
And in order to keep the application open we need to add the following line where we say exit and in

03:59.360 --> 04:06.800
here and Dot exec and there are two methods and the one that we want to use is the one with the underscore

04:06.890 --> 04:07.800
at the end.

04:07.880 --> 04:11.140
So exec on the score and brackets.

04:11.160 --> 04:16.640
So now let's save it again and run the application again and you will see that the application keeps

04:16.700 --> 04:17.360
open.

04:17.510 --> 04:20.290
So this is our beautiful window that we have just created.

04:20.300 --> 04:25.610
We haven't given it any paramita so we don't tell it how big it should be.

04:25.610 --> 04:30.900
There is no title here nothing any more none of this information is given.

04:30.980 --> 04:32.680
It says python here OK.

04:32.720 --> 04:35.260
So let's change the title of the window first.

04:35.270 --> 04:40.240
And in order to do so we can simply add something to the window.

04:40.250 --> 04:47.090
So we are showing it here already after having created it at the moment but we can add a lot of things

04:47.090 --> 04:51.640
to it such as buttons we can add a lot of settings here.

04:51.800 --> 04:53.140
And then we just show it.

04:53.180 --> 04:53.750
OK.

04:53.750 --> 05:02.600
So we're going to set the window title for example window type top that one here we're going to set

05:02.600 --> 05:08.570
it to something like a student manager.

05:09.110 --> 05:12.360
OK so let me save that again and run it.

05:13.070 --> 05:18.240
And now if I make it a little bigger you can see now it says student manager.

05:18.260 --> 05:25.430
All right so now let's say we want to have a button I can create a button which will be of cutesie widgets

05:25.450 --> 05:27.890
and that queue push button.

05:27.890 --> 05:30.130
So there's something called queue push button.

05:30.670 --> 05:33.660
And this shows show this button.

05:33.680 --> 05:36.770
So button show and you see a little problem here.

05:36.780 --> 05:41.530
So let's save it and display it or run it as you can see now.

05:42.180 --> 05:45.230
I have a very weird behavior.

05:45.810 --> 05:50.690
And that is that I have this one application let me make it a little bigger.

05:50.930 --> 05:58.830
I can drag it to the side and I have the button as it's own application I can press the button but nothing

05:58.830 --> 06:01.970
will happen and the button is not part of our main window.

06:02.190 --> 06:04.650
So how do we manage this.

06:04.650 --> 06:11.050
How do we get rid of this additional window that I don't need and put it into my main window.

06:11.110 --> 06:18.680
Well you just need to tell the BART and here the cue push button who has parents.

06:18.930 --> 06:22.720
And in this case I'm just going to say your parent is going to be the window.

06:22.920 --> 06:26.150
So this window here is the parent of this button.

06:26.310 --> 06:32.430
So if you run it again you will see that suddenly this button is inside of our window.

06:32.430 --> 06:37.660
Now we of course can give this button a title or a text.

06:37.710 --> 06:46.830
There is a set text method here where we can just entered text here my Or just click me click me and

06:46.890 --> 06:48.370
save and run.

06:48.720 --> 06:51.500
And as you can see there is this Click Me button.

06:52.170 --> 06:57.000
Now of course we can add other objects in here as well.

06:57.000 --> 07:04.440
For example if I want to add a checkbox I can just go ahead and use cutesy widgets as you can see these

07:04.440 --> 07:10.290
cutesy widgets or cute widgets contains all the different widgets that we want to use such as buttons

07:10.710 --> 07:11.420
and so forth.

07:11.430 --> 07:19.950
So combo box call you check box button group so you can see if all of those classes of the QAD widgets

07:20.040 --> 07:20.820
in here.

07:20.820 --> 07:26.260
So they all inherit from cutesie widgets are cute widgets and the one I want to use is checkbox.

07:26.610 --> 07:31.710
So I'm just going to say checkbox is going to be inside of the window because otherwise it's gone or

07:32.070 --> 07:35.060
it's going to be a separate window again.

07:35.070 --> 07:41.220
We don't want that and the checkbox can also have a text so there is also something called set text.

07:41.220 --> 07:42.340
So let's do that.

07:42.510 --> 07:47.260
Let's give it detects something like I am a check box.

07:47.880 --> 07:53.730
And now in order to display this checkbox we need to call this show method.

07:53.760 --> 07:55.650
So we just say show here again.

07:55.920 --> 07:59.290
And now let's run it and we will see them.

07:59.460 --> 08:03.810
There is this checkbox and there's this button and there on top of each other and I cannot even click

08:03.810 --> 08:06.170
the button because the check box is in its way.

08:06.420 --> 08:09.750
So how do I get that solved.

08:09.930 --> 08:17.810
Well I can position the check box at a specific area of my screen so I could say something like checkbox

08:17.850 --> 08:20.210
that said geometry.

08:20.220 --> 08:22.000
So there's something called Geometry.

08:22.290 --> 08:31.790
And here I can enter as you can see a x int which is the x position a Y and which is the y position

08:32.130 --> 08:36.370
a W which is to with and H which is the height.

08:36.540 --> 08:40.470
So I can just say OK put these 30 pixels to the right.

08:40.500 --> 08:46.590
One hundred pixels to the bottom and make it 200 pixels wide and 100 pixel height.

08:47.130 --> 08:50.290
So if I do that I save it and I run it.

08:50.460 --> 08:51.730
And now you see it is gone.

08:51.750 --> 08:52.460
Where is it.

08:52.680 --> 08:54.870
Well it is there.

08:55.080 --> 09:00.280
So we have to increase the size of our window in order to display it.

09:00.360 --> 09:05.190
And now as you can see the checkbox works and it has this beautiful text and it says I'm a checkbox

09:05.190 --> 09:07.730
and the button works and all is good.

09:08.100 --> 09:14.390
And now you might say Oh damn now I will have to do all of that manually I need to code everything I

09:14.400 --> 09:16.510
need to write so many lines of code.

09:16.740 --> 09:24.480
Well you could and that is definitely a way that works but you can also drag and drop UI elements and

09:24.930 --> 09:31.540
how to do that and what to do for that is is what you're going to learn in the next video.

09:31.680 --> 09:33.520
So see you there.
