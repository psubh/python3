00:00.070 --> 00:06.450
We'll come back in this video we are going to check out matplotlib p y plot which we already have used

00:06.720 --> 00:08.960
but I just wanted to show you something with it.

00:09.090 --> 00:17.840
So first of all I'm going to add this month plod who lived in line which allows us to show this play

00:17.850 --> 00:21.820
or display graphs straight away in our Jupiter notebook.

00:22.020 --> 00:23.900
And now I'm going to import something.

00:23.900 --> 00:33.210
So we have used that already where we said implored Matt plod lead that p y plot and there we said something

00:33.210 --> 00:35.060
like S P L T.

00:35.250 --> 00:41.370
And then we used this approach right where we just said OK now I'm gonna use it as POTUS I'm going to

00:41.370 --> 00:43.220
make it easier for myself.

00:43.260 --> 00:49.770
So we just said he does show where I actually plot first plot and then we had the values that we would

00:49.770 --> 00:50.510
like to plot.

00:50.640 --> 00:55.380
So we had access and wise but we can also of course just add lists in here.

00:55.380 --> 01:02.130
So one to three and another lists five four or five something like that.

01:02.210 --> 01:07.820
And now I can use the LTE show function in order to show it.

01:07.830 --> 01:10.350
And as you can see now this graph is displayed here.

01:10.380 --> 01:11.900
So what is happening here.

01:12.060 --> 01:16.180
Well we are importing something that is called met plot.

01:16.560 --> 01:24.510
And in the air there is an aspect or a part of it which is called y plot and we say OK we want to import

01:24.510 --> 01:32.810
that whole thing but we want to call it Alte because we don't want to constantly use this whole name.

01:32.820 --> 01:36.160
So let me just show you another example of how this could look like.

01:36.180 --> 01:40.290
So in other in another line we could go ahead and use it.

01:40.290 --> 01:48.360
And in this way where we just say okay import met plot live thought y plot and then you will have to

01:48.360 --> 01:50.200
go ahead and use it like that.

01:50.370 --> 01:58.730
So you'd have to say okay from that plot lib thought y plot could call the plot function for format

01:58.770 --> 02:02.120
plot Lipp thought of plot use the show function.

02:02.160 --> 02:06.480
So of course this is going to work as well as you can see now displaying it correctly as well.

02:06.810 --> 02:13.740
But with this as we just say OK we want to rename this whole thing and we want to use it with a shorter

02:13.740 --> 02:17.100
version or a more descriptive way or whatever.

02:17.110 --> 02:20.490
In this case we just want to use a very short version of it.

02:20.490 --> 02:23.790
PLDT is descriptive enough so we know what it's about.

02:23.790 --> 02:27.670
And at the same time with a very short time we can type very easily.

02:28.200 --> 02:32.130
But of course this is the exact same result pretty much what we get.

02:32.340 --> 02:36.240
But this well that's really more convenient.

02:36.540 --> 02:39.860
So there isn't a disadvantage by using this though.

02:40.020 --> 02:46.020
So here it's very obvious as we are saying capital-T is coming from this part here.

02:46.140 --> 02:53.190
But if somebody is checking our code for the first time and we have a bunch of code very complex code

02:53.190 --> 02:59.940
with lots of lines and so forth and somebody checks it out and looks at this PLDT and doesn't find a

02:59.940 --> 03:02.640
class it is called purity or something like that.

03:02.730 --> 03:04.300
Then you might be confused.

03:04.650 --> 03:09.840
So he would have then to check the imports as well and the imports are at the very first line.

03:09.840 --> 03:15.540
So usually somebody doesn't really look at the imports at first so he just checks out the whole code

03:15.570 --> 03:20.360
and then later on he checks out ok that there are at the top there is this import.

03:20.440 --> 03:27.090
So he of course can use the search functionality and so forth but on an obvious way if you want to make

03:27.090 --> 03:30.270
it super obvious then you would have of course the whole name here.

03:30.270 --> 03:34.810
So we're just saying Mackler lead that p y plot dot plot.

03:34.860 --> 03:37.020
So this is how we of course.

03:37.020 --> 03:40.330
And what also more can also use it now.

03:41.330 --> 03:43.240
This here says there.

03:43.340 --> 03:48.290
We want to use these Mettler live but only the p y plot part.

03:48.290 --> 03:52.230
We can also use it like that where we just import the map plot lib.

03:52.430 --> 03:58.120
So let me restart my kernel so that I can show you because now everything is already imported.

03:58.130 --> 04:04.820
Now if I run this code again I'm not on getting an error it doesn't have an attribute called p y plot

04:05.150 --> 04:10.730
so we can say something where we have to add this plot here for it to work.

04:10.730 --> 04:19.150
Or alternatively we can say from that plot the lid import p y plot.

04:19.250 --> 04:21.490
So that's another way of doing it.

04:21.710 --> 04:28.940
And now it shows me something where it says OK figure size 640 times for 80 with one x.

04:28.940 --> 04:35.950
So it doesn't actually display it well it calls the show function but because this line of code here

04:35.960 --> 04:37.400
is not executed.

04:37.490 --> 04:39.320
We don't get to see any graph.

04:39.330 --> 04:44.150
So let me run that code at the top and then run and run that code at the bottom and as you can see now

04:44.480 --> 04:45.920
it actually shows the graph.

04:46.050 --> 04:50.010
And now you saw what this line stands for what it actually does.

04:50.030 --> 04:58.910
So it allows us to show graphs in line our Jupiter notebook there there is one more thing about this

04:58.910 --> 04:59.890
approach here.

05:00.050 --> 05:07.600
Now still using the whole name but of course now I could go ahead and just say OK use plot that plot

05:07.750 --> 05:09.440
or P-word plot that show.

05:09.590 --> 05:13.820
So if I run that code you see it's still working correctly.

05:14.060 --> 05:16.900
So as you can see there are multiple different ways.

05:16.910 --> 05:23.900
And if you see code in a way in one of those ways don't be confused you will see that some people use

05:23.900 --> 05:27.060
this approach other people use another approach and so forth.

05:27.110 --> 05:30.930
So now you know that all of them are fine and all of them are valid.

05:30.980 --> 05:34.020
And whenever you come across one of those you'll be fine.

05:35.510 --> 05:40.240
There is one more reason for renaming your import.

05:40.520 --> 05:44.380
So let's say we would use this approach that we have here.

05:44.510 --> 05:54.110
So let me show you real quick so we have it twice from Matt love Matt Plaut lib import by the plot.

05:54.140 --> 06:00.910
Now there could be something called matplotlib 1 2 3 and it also has something called y plot.

06:01.110 --> 06:06.000
And now if I use this word plot then it will be confused.

06:06.000 --> 06:11.870
So our program will be confused and it will try to access plot in that plot live and maybe it doesn't

06:11.870 --> 06:17.350
have a plot or a show function and then suddenly our code doesn't work anymore.

06:17.720 --> 06:23.440
And then this approach here really comes into play where it really makes sense where we just say Okay

06:23.660 --> 06:25.170
use it as Piel tea.

06:25.280 --> 06:33.020
And now if somebody goes ahead and has something like mad plot live 2:59 that pre-wire plot then we

06:33.020 --> 06:37.700
can just call it PLG 2:59 or you can call it whatever he likes.

06:37.820 --> 06:44.420
So now he can have a shortcut which really indicates that we're explicitly talking about this module

06:44.420 --> 06:46.690
here and not the one there.

06:47.050 --> 06:50.310
OK that's just a little side note here.

06:50.510 --> 06:56.600
But usually you won't run into these problems very often so just for you to know that this is a possibility

06:56.690 --> 06:58.790
and that's how you can solve this problem.

06:58.910 --> 07:03.140
But as I said you won't usually come across as problem very often.

07:03.140 --> 07:08.100
All right so now you've seen how you can use modules and what the different approaches are.

07:08.570 --> 07:11.870
And in the next video we're going to create a module in a folder.

07:11.870 --> 07:12.970
So see you there.
