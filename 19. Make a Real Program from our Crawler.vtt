00:00.170 --> 00:07.270
Come back in this video we are going to bring over our crawler to Python.

00:07.560 --> 00:14.850
So so far we have only worked with our Jupiter notebooks but now we can use pi charm in order to use

00:14.850 --> 00:17.830
our whole program in a ID.

00:17.850 --> 00:20.990
And while PI charm is a great idea.

00:21.330 --> 00:27.660
We decided to use Jupiter notebook at the start because it's much easier to follow along.

00:27.860 --> 00:33.750
Mainly at the beginning but as soon as we go to more complex programs it's really helpful to use pi

00:33.750 --> 00:34.470
charm.

00:34.470 --> 00:41.660
So I'm going to create a new python file in here and I'm going to create it with the name crawler.

00:41.670 --> 00:48.390
So I'm just going to call this crawler and I'm going to use a capital C here.

00:48.570 --> 00:50.310
Now this crawler p y.

00:50.640 --> 00:54.300
That's my Python code that I can run.

00:54.300 --> 00:56.250
So in here I can just say something like.

00:56.250 --> 00:58.290
Print Hello world.

00:58.290 --> 01:04.560
And now in order to run the code I just go to run and press run of course you can also use a short code

01:04.890 --> 01:13.440
for short cuts and then can a press run and decide to do I'll use my crawler here and there we are.

01:13.440 --> 01:16.810
We have printed hello world onto our screen.

01:17.010 --> 01:20.700
So that's the very first basic statement that we have used.

01:20.850 --> 01:27.110
Now what we can do is we can bring over our whole code from here in order to execute it in PI charm

01:27.120 --> 01:33.200
in order to have it in a more structured way and more advanced way.

01:33.240 --> 01:41.290
And so in order to do that I'm going to create a new Python package and I'm going to call this Python

01:41.290 --> 01:46.130
package crawler crawl.

01:46.870 --> 01:52.060
All right so as you can see now there is a new folder in here which is my Python package and it has

01:52.060 --> 01:53.740
an image file.

01:54.040 --> 01:58.080
And in here I will need to add stuff as I go.

01:58.300 --> 02:03.570
As you might recall from the modules video where we used modules and wanted to import them.

02:03.700 --> 02:07.380
So in this crawler I'm going to create a new file.

02:07.420 --> 02:14.330
So I'm going to create a new python file and that will be called cruel article.

02:14.770 --> 02:16.030
So it should be a python file.

02:16.030 --> 02:17.140
I'm going to call it like that.

02:17.140 --> 02:19.150
And then I'm going to create a new one as well.

02:19.150 --> 02:30.790
A new python file that I'm going to call article fetcher and now we can copy the code from Jupiter notebook.

02:30.790 --> 02:37.870
So let's go here and corrupt the copy It is called Article and put it into our crawl.

02:37.910 --> 02:40.830
Article Why file so select across the article.

02:40.870 --> 02:44.390
Here at the top and put everything in there.

02:44.440 --> 02:46.480
So then you can save this.

02:46.870 --> 02:50.640
And now let's go ahead and do the same with the article fetcher.

02:51.130 --> 02:57.250
So let's take all this article fetcher stuff up to that point.

02:57.250 --> 03:02.960
So this is just part of the class only that is going to be required in the article fetcher.

03:03.160 --> 03:06.900
And now when we have that you can see that there are some errors here.

03:06.970 --> 03:09.310
So it says time is not known.

03:09.370 --> 03:10.820
Requests is not known.

03:10.840 --> 03:16.530
And the cool thing here is that this even this pie chart tells us where errors are.

03:16.750 --> 03:23.950
So what I can do here is to find solutions so I just press over it and then I can press command of one

03:23.950 --> 03:30.040
in order to get more information or I can just open it up here as you can see import this name create

03:30.170 --> 03:31.850
paramita and so forth.

03:31.960 --> 03:34.830
And what we want to import is actual time.

03:34.840 --> 03:38.880
So as you can see there is time there date time and so forth.

03:38.890 --> 03:45.550
So the one that we want to use is time and we can of course also just go ahead and copy the code from

03:45.550 --> 03:46.040
here.

03:46.060 --> 03:48.580
So import request and import time.

03:48.640 --> 03:59.200
So I'm going to add that in here and poured time and import requests and as you see when I enter something

03:59.200 --> 04:01.150
it already predicts what I would like to have.

04:01.150 --> 04:03.460
Or it gives me some choices.

04:03.550 --> 04:06.990
And in this case I can just go ahead and use requests.

04:07.030 --> 04:13.390
Now there is this cross article still missing and how do I import cross article because I have the article

04:13.390 --> 04:17.790
and it's my own program program or my own file here.

04:18.100 --> 04:21.510
And I would like to use it but I need to import it somehow.

04:21.610 --> 04:28.330
Well Therefore we need to use our in or top y file.

04:28.360 --> 04:32.270
So let's check out the in a file as you can see it's empty.

04:32.290 --> 04:40.840
So I can just say underscore underskirt all underscore underscore is equal to my list of Karole article

04:42.910 --> 04:50.160
article and article fetchers so article fetcher.

04:50.560 --> 04:57.800
Now let me say that as well with command s or file save all or save all.

04:58.090 --> 05:02.570
And now I can go ahead and use it in here so I can import it here.

05:02.590 --> 05:09.860
And how do I imported from and here daughter cross article import called Article.

05:09.880 --> 05:15.850
So what I'm saying here is from this quote article file which is within the same folder.

05:15.850 --> 05:17.500
That's why we have this dot here.

05:17.500 --> 05:21.180
So this quote article file is in the same folder as the article fetcher.

05:21.250 --> 05:26.770
That's why I can use a dot here then I'm saying which file I would like to import.

05:26.890 --> 05:34.630
And from that I would like to import the actual class called crawled out crawled article Why do I do

05:34.630 --> 05:34.840
that.

05:34.840 --> 05:37.880
Well because in Kroeber article there could be multiple classes.

05:37.900 --> 05:45.040
So some people they create multiple classes in one file and then you need to specify or you could specify

05:45.040 --> 05:48.420
which of those classes you would like to import.

05:48.430 --> 05:52.540
All right so I'm just going to say the article and as you can see here suddenly this era that we had

05:52.540 --> 05:56.070
before disappeared.

05:56.080 --> 05:56.790
All right.

05:56.810 --> 06:05.530
And now what we can do is we can pretty much use our article fetcher and fetch and all of this stuff

06:05.620 --> 06:09.280
so we can just go ahead and copy that code here.

06:09.340 --> 06:12.650
We're going to adjust it a little bit but we can copy it from here.

06:12.820 --> 06:21.040
So let's go back in our cruller the wife file and in here instead of printing hello world I would like

06:21.040 --> 06:23.540
to use my fetcher.

06:23.750 --> 06:27.340
Is going to be an article fetcher and as you can see I'm still getting this error because I need to

06:27.370 --> 06:34.090
import article fetcher then I have my calendar where I define how many entries I would like to be displayed

06:34.120 --> 06:37.130
and this print statement Well I can leave it there for now.

06:37.230 --> 06:43.260
But let's find a way to fix this error here and you might remember how to fix it while we can of course

06:43.320 --> 06:50.790
use those same imports that we did here where we say import or from crowd article import carolled article

06:50.790 --> 06:51.930
and so forth.

06:51.930 --> 07:00.450
Or we can change our cruller that way so that we can just say something like import crawler.

07:01.320 --> 07:07.050
So then we would import this whole Python package or this whole folder which is a module which contains

07:07.050 --> 07:08.840
all of the things that we need.

07:08.960 --> 07:13.020
Now that by itself is not going to do much and use the import statement.

07:13.020 --> 07:14.300
Well that's one point.

07:14.400 --> 07:18.510
But the other thing is we need to adjust this file a little bit.

07:18.660 --> 07:27.270
So in here now we can say from DOT crawled article import crawled article and from that article fetcher

07:27.360 --> 07:29.740
import article fetcher.

07:29.880 --> 07:31.680
And now let's save that file once again.

07:31.710 --> 07:35.140
Let's go back to our cruller Depue why.

07:36.270 --> 07:38.430
And my guess is it's still shown the error.

07:38.430 --> 07:48.480
So let me import the crawler once again and in case this error still appears you can of course from

07:48.990 --> 07:53.320
cruller start article fetcher import article feature.

07:53.670 --> 07:55.890
So you can of course still do that.

07:55.890 --> 07:59.900
All right so now let's run the code and I'm going to start it.

07:59.910 --> 08:06.500
And as you can see now it gives me the articles that I was searching for.

08:06.510 --> 08:12.690
So the emoji is and the title of the article of course you can get a lot more from it but that's it

08:12.690 --> 08:16.850
for now and more it's everything that I would like to have for now.

08:17.100 --> 08:22.930
So now you see how you can go ahead and pretty much use Python.

08:23.100 --> 08:29.400
And as you can see it's also very powerful and can help you a lot when writing code and you will find

08:29.400 --> 08:36.300
arrows much easier than we did before and that's why the next chapter is going to be all about exceptions.

08:36.330 --> 08:37.460
So see you there.
