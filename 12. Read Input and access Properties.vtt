00:00.480 --> 00:06.080
We'll come back and this video we are going to extend our main window class in order to add functionality.

00:06.240 --> 00:15.330
So what I want to do is I want to instead of having checkboxes here to have a simple text field or edit

00:15.330 --> 00:20.390
text it's called text edit and line at it.

00:20.400 --> 00:25.200
I want to use the line edit because I just want to enter some text and there's line edit and one some

00:25.200 --> 00:30.570
body press this button the text that is entered here should just be printed onto the console.

00:30.570 --> 00:36.900
Nothing too fancy but that's what will help you to understand how you can get values from your UI elements.

00:36.900 --> 00:42.770
So this push button has the name my button and I would like to change the name of it.

00:42.780 --> 00:52.560
So in order to do so I press on the push button and then I go to dequeue abstract button and I'm changing

00:52.560 --> 00:53.490
the text here.

00:53.730 --> 00:59.300
So I'm going to change the text to something like safe.

00:59.450 --> 01:03.390
So it's just going to save the data whatever we enter here as text will be saved.

01:03.570 --> 01:09.570
And in our case it will just be printed onto the console but we could save that somewhere in the file

01:09.570 --> 01:11.070
or something like that.

01:11.070 --> 01:14.410
OK so I'm going to save this save this main window UI.

01:14.610 --> 01:18.530
I go back to my pie charm in here.

01:18.570 --> 01:24.300
I run my build wife file in order to recompile my UI.

01:24.600 --> 01:27.600
And once that is done I can see the changes have been made.

01:27.600 --> 01:31.420
Well I can see directly but we will see it in a second.

01:31.500 --> 01:38.920
And what I want to happen now is instead of using my CB toggle because there should be no Sebille check.

01:39.120 --> 01:43.110
C B C B.

01:43.140 --> 01:45.210
So you see there's no checkbox anymore.

01:45.210 --> 01:47.730
I had it called check box or c.b.

01:47.740 --> 01:49.830
You can see no checkbox either.

01:49.830 --> 01:54.630
So actually I should not be able to access the CB anymore if I run this code.

01:54.720 --> 01:58.590
And actually I'm running the code once again by far on the main code.

01:58.590 --> 02:00.300
You can see I'm getting an error here.

02:00.380 --> 02:04.980
It says you main window object has no attributes Sibi so it cannot access this anymore.

02:05.070 --> 02:10.470
Ok so I'm going to get rid of this but what I want to do instead is I want to call a method that will

02:10.470 --> 02:15.630
take care of button clicks and that's the beauty about having a class because now you can create methods

02:15.650 --> 02:22.290
in here and I'm just going to say OK on button click.

02:22.290 --> 02:29.910
I want to call something where I execute some code and then here I'm just going for now press or write

02:29.910 --> 02:35.930
something like On button on Osco click OK.

02:35.940 --> 02:38.280
So that's it for now.

02:38.280 --> 02:45.000
Now in here I need to of course tell it now to connect with this on button click.

02:45.270 --> 02:46.840
Because otherwise it won't work.

02:47.010 --> 02:51.530
But now it doesn't know where it is on button click is coming from so I need to tell it it's in your

02:51.530 --> 02:54.410
self so it's self dot on button click.

02:54.420 --> 03:00.870
In this case because the on button click method is in the same class and it's in the same main window

03:00.870 --> 03:02.220
class pretty much.

03:02.670 --> 03:04.210
OK so now it's connected.

03:04.470 --> 03:10.500
And now what we should see is if we press on the button then it should write something like On button

03:10.500 --> 03:11.090
click.

03:11.250 --> 03:18.060
So let me run that press safe and you see on button click post saved or was pressed.

03:18.060 --> 03:24.450
Now what I want to happen is that if I enter some code in here or some text my text or whatever and

03:24.450 --> 03:28.460
I perceive that the text is displayed next to it.

03:28.470 --> 03:29.750
So how do I do that.

03:29.910 --> 03:39.450
Well I need to read the data from that text and in order to do so I need to get the input from that

03:39.450 --> 03:40.650
text.

03:40.650 --> 03:45.980
Now let's go back to cute to see how this element is called.

03:46.020 --> 03:47.770
And it's called line edits.

03:47.910 --> 03:50.590
So let me change the name of the line at it.

03:50.850 --> 03:55.420
So once I press on it and I go to the object name here I can change it.

03:55.440 --> 03:58.770
So let's say I change it to input very basic.

03:58.800 --> 03:59.750
Now it's called input.

03:59.760 --> 04:03.260
And if I save this now and I go back here I run my build.

04:03.390 --> 04:09.450
I don't need to open it but I run my build here and I recompile pretty much my UI.

04:09.450 --> 04:14.140
Now go back to Maine where I can do now is I can access.

04:14.180 --> 04:16.050
Self-taught Why Dot.

04:16.350 --> 04:19.490
And here we created this thing called input.

04:20.070 --> 04:27.450
So let's use inputs and we want to get something from it.

04:27.620 --> 04:30.790
But before we do that we're just going to set something to it.

04:30.900 --> 04:36.850
So I'm just going to say OK set the text to exclamation mark exclamation mark exclamation mark.

04:36.990 --> 04:42.570
So this way I can actually set the text in the constructor so if I run this again you can see that there

04:42.570 --> 04:47.700
are three exclamation marks in here because within the constructors so pretty much when this object

04:47.700 --> 04:48.480
is created.

04:48.510 --> 04:51.100
And in this case the whole window is created.

04:51.150 --> 04:54.650
I said the UI input.

04:55.110 --> 04:59.670
I said its text attribute two exclamation marks.

04:59.670 --> 05:05.790
So if I check out what this text attribute is it's pretty much in here.

05:07.280 --> 05:09.240
Is this attribute here.

05:09.370 --> 05:16.000
So currently it's empty but after initialization there are three exclamation marks in here.

05:16.000 --> 05:29.510
So even if I write something here like I know what's up and safe this recompile my built and I go to

05:29.510 --> 05:30.680
my main again.

05:30.680 --> 05:36.800
You will see that it still has three exclamation marks and that is because this here overwrites pretty

05:36.800 --> 05:42.120
much anything that we needed in cutesie or in the qued editor or creator.

05:42.380 --> 05:47.340
So let's look here and here we should search for highwater.

05:47.420 --> 05:48.950
They were thinsulate UI.

05:48.950 --> 05:53.570
So that's the method that is called and that takes in the changes that we have made.

05:53.570 --> 06:00.620
So for example to my button I've changed the name to save button or to text of it the same for the import

06:00.950 --> 06:02.570
text is said to.

06:02.570 --> 06:03.630
Hi what's up.

06:03.890 --> 06:05.910
So we translated that here.

06:06.020 --> 06:13.790
But this translates to why is called before this constructor is called so the constructor pretty much

06:13.820 --> 06:16.290
overrides whatever was written in there.

06:16.380 --> 06:21.080
And that's exactly what the beauty about it is because now we can pretty much adjust it our way as we

06:21.080 --> 06:21.760
please.

06:21.970 --> 06:22.530
OK.

06:22.640 --> 06:24.570
So that's how we can set the text.

06:24.650 --> 06:26.970
But how do we get the text.

06:27.230 --> 06:29.510
Well very similar.

06:29.600 --> 06:35.850
So let's create a new variable called text and we'll just say self-taught UI data input.

06:36.200 --> 06:45.980
And here there is a method called text and that will pretty much give us the text from the UI input

06:46.310 --> 06:49.870
which is our line edit.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.380
So this thing here.

06:52.520 --> 06:53.460
OK.

06:54.080 --> 07:02.860
Now what we can do is we can display this text or print that text onto our console.

07:02.870 --> 07:04.260
So let me save it again.

07:04.280 --> 07:10.040
Let's run it and you will see what's up is here so let me press the save button and you can see an button

07:10.040 --> 07:10.630
click.

07:10.760 --> 07:12.040
Hi what's up.

07:12.040 --> 07:21.790
Or I changed the text and I pressed the save button and you see I changed the text is printed here.

07:21.950 --> 07:26.600
So now you can pretty much get the text from it and use it for whatever.

07:26.630 --> 07:34.370
You could also get the state of your checkbox and of pretty much any other object that you have.

07:34.550 --> 07:40.260
So if we take our check box once again real quick I just drag it in here.

07:40.280 --> 07:43.820
But there is something called it's state.

07:43.850 --> 07:45.690
So is it checked or not.

07:45.830 --> 07:47.340
And here it's called checked.

07:47.450 --> 07:53.690
So I could get the checked state and read it and then based on whether the user has checked it or not.

07:53.690 --> 07:55.070
I could run some code.

07:55.070 --> 08:00.980
So if the user has checked the code and I press save then I could save it if the user doesn't check

08:01.040 --> 08:06.890
check box and I press save and I would just ignore the save button for example so I could only executed

08:06.890 --> 08:12.350
if checked is actually checked or this checkbox is checked because otherwise the user for example hasn't

08:12.350 --> 08:16.130
accepted our terms of use or something like that.

08:16.250 --> 08:20.900
So I'm going to get rid of this checkbox and I'm going to save this hand in the next video we are going

08:20.900 --> 08:28.960
to create our little B.M. I calculator and this time not with just a console but actually with a UI.

08:29.090 --> 08:30.760
So see you in the next video.
