00:00.400 --> 00:06.210
Come back in this video we are going to check out if conditions and they are super super useful and

00:06.360 --> 00:09.970
a very important basic concept of any programming language.

00:10.170 --> 00:12.050
So let's go ahead and start with it.

00:12.240 --> 00:18.960
I'm going to create a variable that I'm going to set to 15 and then I'm going to use an IF statement

00:19.010 --> 00:21.270
in an order you create an if statement.

00:21.360 --> 00:27.650
You can go ahead and use the F term and then afterwards you can write the condition.

00:27.660 --> 00:37.950
So in my case I'm going to check if an is a lower than 18 and if it's lower than 18 then I want to execute

00:37.950 --> 00:38.340
some code.

00:38.340 --> 00:45.360
So you see I'm using a colon and I'm writing something now so I'm going to write the code in here that

00:45.360 --> 00:46.400
I want to execute.

00:46.410 --> 00:48.980
If this condition here is met.

00:49.140 --> 00:56.280
So if end is lower than 18 then please print something and it's important that this print statement

00:56.310 --> 01:01.940
is indented by a tap because if it is not then Python will not understand what's going on.

01:02.130 --> 01:09.480
So whenever you use or you want to run some code within an if statement if the condition is met you

01:09.480 --> 01:12.380
need to indented or writes on this guys.

01:12.420 --> 01:19.950
I'm going to say something like you may not vote because if somebody is younger than 18 he's not allowed

01:19.950 --> 01:20.460
to vote.

01:20.520 --> 01:22.090
So let's execute that code.

01:22.170 --> 01:26.860
And as you can see this statement is written onto the console.

01:26.910 --> 01:30.710
So this condition here is met because and is just 15.

01:30.750 --> 01:34.260
That's why the statement is executed here.

01:34.320 --> 01:39.760
So if somebody let's say is 19 years old now let's execute the code again.

01:39.960 --> 01:43.480
And as you can see nothing is printed onto the console.

01:43.710 --> 01:48.110
And that is because and is higher than 18.

01:48.330 --> 01:50.390
And that's why this condition is not met.

01:50.430 --> 01:54.220
So this code is never executed.

01:54.220 --> 01:57.800
Now let's add another code in here another line.

01:58.110 --> 02:04.790
I am not indented So as you can see I'm not indented.

02:04.890 --> 02:06.260
It's printed on two.

02:06.270 --> 02:06.950
Why is that.

02:07.080 --> 02:09.910
Well because this line of code is not indented.

02:09.930 --> 02:13.990
That's why it's not considered part of this if statement.

02:14.160 --> 02:20.040
So it's not considered as the body of this if statement which means that it's not execute while it's

02:20.190 --> 02:20.790
executed.

02:20.790 --> 02:23.740
In this case because while this condition is not met right.

02:23.940 --> 02:26.720
So if I do like that I can execute it.

02:26.730 --> 02:33.420
As you can see it's still executed but if I indent that print statement and execute it now it's not

02:34.170 --> 02:41.060
printed onto the console because it thinks or in this case it is part of that statement.

02:41.280 --> 02:48.680
So I'm going to get the indention lost or I'm going to delete indention so I'm going to do and then

02:48.720 --> 02:50.590
only this print statement here.

02:50.730 --> 02:51.770
You may not vote.

02:52.080 --> 02:52.440
All right.

02:52.440 --> 02:59.330
So what if I wanted to have a statement for all the other cases.

02:59.340 --> 03:05.370
So if somebody doesn't meet this condition then I want to write some other code.

03:05.580 --> 03:08.660
And that's why you have this if else.

03:08.790 --> 03:12.260
So if and else if is the first request.

03:12.270 --> 03:16.580
And if that's something that you can simply execute the code which comes off or else.

03:16.620 --> 03:20.210
So let's check out how this looks going to create another variable.

03:20.220 --> 03:31.120
I'm just going to set that to 10 and then I'm going to check if am is lower than five then print is

03:31.120 --> 03:35.940
simple and is lower than 5.

03:36.870 --> 03:49.110
But then on the other hand else just print something like in case higher than fourth or you could even

03:49.110 --> 03:58.060
write something like can or if condition is not met.

03:58.200 --> 03:59.570
So let's run that code.

03:59.840 --> 04:03.720
And as you can see I get the statement here if condition is not met.

04:03.810 --> 04:08.670
And that's because M is 10 so am lower 5 is not true.

04:08.670 --> 04:11.900
So this condition here that we have is not true.

04:12.270 --> 04:20.370
That means it just skips this line of code and directly jumps to the else part of this if else statement.

04:20.550 --> 04:24.050
So it executes the code within the else statement.

04:24.360 --> 04:33.630
If we add a line here to our IF and below 18 you may not vote if you want to extent that we simply add

04:33.720 --> 04:40.060
else colon and then in the next line indented we write whatever we want to write.

04:40.320 --> 04:44.070
Please go and vote.

04:44.070 --> 04:50.580
So now let's execute that code again and as you can see it says Please go and vote here on my console.

04:52.920 --> 04:55.390
And that is pretty much if and else.

04:55.530 --> 05:02.370
So we will use if and L statements quite a lot and you will also see how to use LLF which can cover

05:02.370 --> 05:04.830
multiple other cases in between.

05:04.830 --> 05:06.520
But that's something for later.

05:06.600 --> 05:12.060
For now we're good to go for next video where we'll check out comparison operators.

05:12.060 --> 05:14.160
And this is a comparison operator right here.

05:14.160 --> 05:15.160
This sign here.

05:15.390 --> 05:22.890
So lower than is a comparison operator and we need to check out all the comparison operators in order

05:22.890 --> 05:28.370
to understand if statements even better and use it accordingly in the future.

05:28.380 --> 05:30.180
So see you in the next video.
