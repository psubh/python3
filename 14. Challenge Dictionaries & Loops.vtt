00:00.290 --> 00:01.230
Work come back.

00:01.290 --> 00:05.530
Now in this video I would like to give you some hints for the next exercise.

00:05.580 --> 00:08.460
And that is to read d'Artois selection.

00:08.490 --> 00:15.810
See as we file and calculate which name was assigned most often in the whole USA or the whole country

00:15.810 --> 00:16.650
of the USA.

00:16.830 --> 00:24.780
So pretty much which name is the one that was given most of the time and first read the data into a

00:24.780 --> 00:32.640
dictionary and count how often each first name occurs then analyze the dictionary and find out the most

00:32.640 --> 00:33.890
common first name.

00:34.080 --> 00:39.270
And note that if you want to add two numbers you may have to convert a string to a number.

00:39.570 --> 00:41.320
Write all your code into one cell.

00:41.340 --> 00:44.320
So the one cell thing why would you do that.

00:44.340 --> 00:50.730
Well if we check this out here we open a file like that and we have done that in the past where we say

00:50.730 --> 01:01.380
data slash names start see as the and type of opening and it's going to be read and now in here for

01:01.470 --> 01:07.420
a line in a file I could print the line and then break.

01:07.440 --> 01:14.160
So if I do that and actually I'm having an error because file is not known so after execute.

01:14.190 --> 01:15.590
Now I can execute it.

01:15.750 --> 01:18.510
And you can see now I get ID name year and so forth.

01:18.510 --> 01:19.980
Now I executed again.

01:19.980 --> 01:24.660
I get the first entry I get the second entry the third entry and so forth.

01:24.660 --> 01:28.760
So as you can see this is not really what we would like to have.

01:28.830 --> 01:31.920
So use the same cell that will really help you.

01:32.100 --> 01:40.260
So instead of doing it in two different cells do it in one cell and by by cell I mean these blocks here

01:40.260 --> 01:40.940
that we have.

01:41.070 --> 01:41.720
OK.

01:41.970 --> 01:50.160
Then of course you can use with open here and there will be the cleaner version because then your file

01:50.160 --> 01:55.360
will be closed as soon as it's not required anymore or some as its work is done.

01:56.130 --> 02:02.580
And here we need to enter as a file and then we run the code and the code that we would like to run

02:02.580 --> 02:10.530
would be for example this for loop here and always be careful with the indents the indentation that

02:10.530 --> 02:11.430
it's always correct.

02:11.430 --> 02:14.720
Now if you run that and you can use it differently.

02:14.970 --> 02:15.500
OK.

02:15.630 --> 02:21.260
And then about this number thing that I was talking about where you should add two numbers together.

02:21.390 --> 02:24.880
Be careful because you get them in a string so something like.

02:25.600 --> 02:26.140
Yeah.

02:26.160 --> 02:33.360
Let's have a look here 15 plus 13.

02:33.510 --> 02:37.770
If you look at it you see it's 1513.

02:37.920 --> 02:39.330
And that's just a string right.

02:39.330 --> 02:42.270
It's just concatenated to each other.

02:42.270 --> 02:45.140
So be careful with that.

02:45.150 --> 02:49.410
Convert them into the right type which is number or string.

02:49.440 --> 02:51.360
And then you can work with it.

02:51.600 --> 02:51.890
All right.

02:51.900 --> 02:53.520
So these were just some tips.

02:53.640 --> 02:57.480
Now please go ahead and use this approach.

02:57.510 --> 03:03.990
And of course you need to use dictionaries right because otherwise it might become difficult to find

03:03.990 --> 03:06.650
out the real answer to your question.

03:06.870 --> 03:13.020
So good luck with that and see you in the next video where I'm going to give you some more advice on

03:13.020 --> 03:15.020
how to get it done.

03:15.030 --> 03:20.910
So here's generally the task then some tips and then the next video will gets even more tips if you

03:20.910 --> 03:22.020
feel like you need any.
