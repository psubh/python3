00:00.420 --> 00:04.580
We'll come back in this video we are going to prepare our BMI calculator.

00:04.590 --> 00:11.150
So you are supposed to build a BMI calculator and of course you can go ahead and tried by yourself already

00:11.400 --> 00:14.370
but you will actually get the exercise in the next video.

00:14.370 --> 00:17.580
But for now let's create the UI for it first.

00:17.700 --> 00:22.630
What we want need is we need this input any more and neither does button.

00:22.650 --> 00:30.570
I'm going to pretty much create a form so I'm going to use a form lay out and let me direct that in

00:30.810 --> 00:36.450
as you can see down the form layout takes up the whole space already and that's because my central widget

00:36.960 --> 00:41.480
is here is selected as a lay out in a grid.

00:41.530 --> 00:46.620
So if I break the law out you can see now suddenly this small little area here.

00:46.780 --> 00:53.230
But I actually wanted to be the whole screen so I just take the lay out in a grid so I press this button

00:53.230 --> 00:53.670
here.

00:53.920 --> 00:54.190
OK.

00:54.190 --> 01:03.990
Now in here I would like to use several elements and one of them is going to be a spin box but it's

01:03.990 --> 01:12.760
double spin box so the user can actually select to enter something but his size in meters.

01:12.790 --> 01:15.560
So it's like one point something.

01:15.790 --> 01:19.300
And what he needs of course is a label here as well.

01:19.300 --> 01:28.480
So let me add the label to the left and I'm just going to call the label body size and or a scale with

01:28.810 --> 01:32.000
height 10 meters.

01:32.890 --> 01:33.400
OK.

01:33.430 --> 01:35.110
So that's number one.

01:35.230 --> 01:42.760
Then another spin box but this time in normal one and this bin box should be the weight in kilograms

01:42.820 --> 01:45.750
and it's just full numbers or whole numbers.

01:45.990 --> 01:46.590
OK.

01:46.750 --> 01:49.150
So I need the label here as well.

01:49.360 --> 01:55.980
And let me add the label and this one will be weight in kilograms.

01:56.830 --> 02:00.770
Then I will need the button to calculate it.

02:00.940 --> 02:04.270
So that me Dragon a push button.

02:04.690 --> 02:14.190
And then when you eat another label below the push button which will indicate the actual body mass index.

02:14.680 --> 02:21.550
So I'm just going to add a number in here and then another label which will actually say that this is

02:21.550 --> 02:25.260
the Body Mass Index so your BMI is.

02:25.720 --> 02:29.180
And then the actual value here.

02:29.210 --> 02:29.860
All right.

02:29.860 --> 02:33.160
So that's pretty much our why for it.

02:33.160 --> 02:34.910
I would like to make some changes though.

02:34.930 --> 02:43.540
So for example pushbuttons shouldn't say push button but it should say something like calculate BMI.

02:44.230 --> 02:49.510
Then here this weight in kilograms while we're at it I would like to show you something.

02:49.570 --> 02:54.430
So let's say you would like to make this in a capital letter.

02:54.760 --> 03:07.180
So if you look at this label you'll find that it has a property here for its CULE label for a text format

03:07.540 --> 03:09.280
which says all the text.

03:09.610 --> 03:17.110
Now plain text is just very basic text rich text however is going to be something that we can adjust

03:17.140 --> 03:18.520
in a very nice way.

03:18.730 --> 03:25.740
So instead of just saying height in AM I can make this in bold.

03:25.780 --> 03:29.300
And how do I do that well with HDMI paging code.

03:29.470 --> 03:36.250
So I'm using the strong tag here and it's a little difficult to read.

03:36.490 --> 03:39.690
But let me click on it.

03:39.700 --> 03:43.340
You can see height in it.

03:43.430 --> 03:48.910
You can double click the label in order to see that it takes a little better so you see height in M

03:48.940 --> 03:50.920
and N is now bold.

03:51.040 --> 03:53.310
You can see the source that's the source that I created.

03:53.350 --> 03:57.890
So I just said strong in so strong is only this in.

03:58.020 --> 03:58.570
OK.

03:58.720 --> 04:06.400
But you can now change the source any time so you could change generally the font size to let's say

04:06.400 --> 04:07.200
14.

04:07.270 --> 04:11.440
It's a lot more readable the same with this weight in kilograms.

04:11.440 --> 04:16.030
You could change it from autotext to rich text.

04:16.030 --> 04:19.020
Now you can right click on it and change to rich text.

04:19.030 --> 04:27.190
As you can see now it could also change to font size here and make this in Bold and the same with your

04:27.190 --> 04:30.280
B-M I so it's changed a rich text of that.

04:30.670 --> 04:33.200
Let's make it 14 as well.

04:33.670 --> 04:34.230
All right.

04:34.420 --> 04:36.960
So that's generally how you can adjust it.

04:36.970 --> 04:39.140
And that's a pretty good way of.

04:39.190 --> 04:43.850
I'd say even though it doesn't fit with the size of this element anymore.

04:43.930 --> 04:55.750
So we could change for example it's font size so let me go to the font size of it.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.620
Here is the font.

04:58.160 --> 04:59.570
And here to point size.

04:59.570 --> 05:02.830
Let's go to 14 as well.

05:02.840 --> 05:06.020
Same for this one point size 14.

05:06.200 --> 05:08.700
Same for this one point size 14.

05:09.140 --> 05:11.920
And for that one as well font size 14.

05:11.990 --> 05:15.430
So now everything is a little bigger and a little more readable.

05:15.770 --> 05:17.420
OK good.

05:17.630 --> 05:19.840
So how do we actually get those values.

05:19.910 --> 05:21.890
Let me save this wife for now.

05:21.950 --> 05:23.300
Let me quickly save it.

05:23.330 --> 05:29.060
And by the way we will need the names right so we will need the name of this double box double spin

05:29.060 --> 05:29.480
box.

05:29.480 --> 05:32.930
We will need the spin box here and so forth.

05:32.930 --> 05:34.720
So let's change those names.

05:34.880 --> 05:38.620
And this one I'm going to change the name of the weight.

05:38.660 --> 05:42.800
So this one here is going to be the weight I'm going to change it to weight.

05:43.380 --> 05:50.560
I'm going to change that one to height and I'm going to change this one here.

05:51.560 --> 05:54.870
So the label three should get a name as well.

05:54.870 --> 05:56.420
That will be the result.

05:56.720 --> 06:02.960
And now finally we only need to give the bottle a name and I'm going to call the button calculate.

06:02.960 --> 06:05.850
So call Q late.

06:05.990 --> 06:09.170
Ok so now they are a little more descriptive those names.

06:09.170 --> 06:11.440
And now you can save it again.

06:11.690 --> 06:14.080
And let's go back to our pide charm.

06:14.120 --> 06:15.010
Let's build it.

06:15.050 --> 06:23.180
So run the build Why file and I would like to quickly show you how you actually get those values so

06:23.180 --> 06:25.880
we don't have this button my button anymore.

06:25.910 --> 06:31.370
Now the button is called differently and I will just get rid of this whole code here.

06:31.580 --> 06:42.070
The only thing that I will create is I'm going to just print new or sell thought why not wait.

06:42.560 --> 06:45.160
And there is something that is called value.

06:45.320 --> 06:48.820
So you can get the value of the spin box by just saying value.

06:49.070 --> 06:58.850
And I'm going to do the same thing with the height and I can set the text of my label in the same way

06:58.850 --> 07:04.220
that we have done it before same you are self-taught UI result thought a set text.

07:04.400 --> 07:07.470
And here it can just set the text to something that one two three four.

07:07.820 --> 07:14.190
OK so let me save this and run my main real quick just to see what you get here.

07:14.360 --> 07:19.410
So you see 0 and 0 0 are given and that's the weight and the height value.

07:19.580 --> 07:24.590
So I have entered where I used them in a other order.

07:24.590 --> 07:28.070
So you could of course change the order here as well.

07:28.100 --> 07:30.620
So to me stop it and run it again.

07:30.620 --> 07:33.330
Now it has zero point zero and zero.

07:33.540 --> 07:38.330
And now this is one two three four so the BMI said two one two three four.

07:38.330 --> 07:44.590
OK so now you see already quite something but we could of course finished this BMI calculator but I'd

07:44.600 --> 07:50.570
say this is a little challenge for you which is pretty good where you can apply the knowledge that you

07:50.570 --> 07:52.310
have gained from the last videos.

07:52.340 --> 07:59.570
So I'd say See you in the next video where I will explain you watched the actual exercises so see you

07:59.570 --> 08:00.040
there.
