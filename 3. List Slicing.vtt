00:00.520 --> 00:05.940
Come back in this video we are going to look at slicing and specifically at least slicing and later

00:05.940 --> 00:08.150
on it's string slicing as well.

00:08.190 --> 00:13.680
That's something that we haven't touched yet which is a super cool feature and it allows us to do pretty

00:13.680 --> 00:14.480
cool stuff.

00:14.490 --> 00:19.470
So let's go ahead and start with slicing the students list before we do that.

00:19.470 --> 00:21.590
There is one thing that I would like to show you though.

00:21.930 --> 00:27.600
I have this list that we have seen multiple times and I'm just going to print students as is now so

00:27.610 --> 00:29.980
you can see Max Monica Eric and Francisca.

00:30.210 --> 00:36.030
And now what you can do is you can also of course exercise one of the entries so you can just say Okay

00:36.030 --> 00:37.750
one and one will be Monica.

00:37.950 --> 00:40.860
But what if you want to access the last element.

00:40.890 --> 00:48.900
So let's say Francisco or if you want to access the last element instead of calculating what the index

00:48.900 --> 00:49.460
would be.

00:49.500 --> 00:58.650
So 0 1 2 3 so you could of course get into three but you can also enter minus one.

00:58.650 --> 01:01.780
So instead of entering three I'm going to use minus one.

01:01.780 --> 01:05.560
And what that will do is it will give me the last element of the list.

01:05.610 --> 01:11.280
So let's see if that's true if I change the list element that I'm going to add ABC as you can see now

01:11.280 --> 01:14.810
it gives me a b c so it doesn't give me Francisco anymore.

01:14.940 --> 01:20.190
So if you want to have the last element you can simply use minus 1 which you want to have the second

01:20.190 --> 01:21.290
last element.

01:21.510 --> 01:24.900
Well probably you guessed it you can enter minus two.

01:24.900 --> 01:27.650
So now as you can see I'm getting Francisca.

01:27.660 --> 01:31.640
So now you simply calculate from the back but you don't start a zero.

01:31.650 --> 01:39.030
But you start at minus 1 so minus one minus two minus three minus 4 for Monica and so forth.

01:39.690 --> 01:44.610
So that is something that is important for the next point which is a list slicing.

01:44.610 --> 01:46.800
So let's say we look at a list slicing.

01:47.220 --> 01:52.360
I'm going to create in you marked down here who list Slye Singh.

01:52.710 --> 01:57.030
And I'm going to use code here of course.

01:57.150 --> 02:04.830
Now let's print students again but this time let's use this slicing and what is that.

02:05.040 --> 02:12.510
Well you can slice a list and create a different list for a short period of time for example like here

02:12.760 --> 02:21.510
I'm just creating it for this particular line of code where I would for example only print out the elements

02:21.540 --> 02:25.770
from the second or from index to to index for it.

02:25.830 --> 02:27.370
So let me just do that.

02:27.450 --> 02:29.950
So you can see I only get Eric and Francisco.

02:30.210 --> 02:37.800
That means I'm getting the index to entry and index three entry for is not included.

02:37.800 --> 02:42.340
So the second value here after the colon is not included.

02:42.690 --> 02:50.820
So if I'd say give me two up to three it will only give me Eric because three is exclusive.

02:50.820 --> 02:53.260
That's why Francisco would not be part of it anymore.

02:53.520 --> 02:59.790
So now I have this little list and I could of course create another list from it less on this course

02:59.790 --> 03:10.920
students could be my students from 1 to 3 for example and that's parentless students present less on

03:10.920 --> 03:12.780
the score students.

03:12.780 --> 03:15.770
And as you can see this would be Monica and Eric.

03:15.770 --> 03:21.630
So it start at the next one and gives me next to as well because three exclusive means two is still

03:21.630 --> 03:22.380
in there.

03:22.680 --> 03:23.310
OK.

03:23.400 --> 03:25.820
So that's called a list slicing.

03:26.100 --> 03:30.320
Now you can do what you have done here or what we have done here.

03:30.420 --> 03:33.380
You can do that with less slicing as well.

03:33.600 --> 03:40.470
So let's say I want to have students from zero to minus 1.

03:40.470 --> 03:41.820
What would that give me.

03:41.820 --> 03:46.320
Well give me everything except for the last element in the list.

03:46.320 --> 03:53.340
So you can easily slice a list by a worse slice away the last piece of list by using this approach here.

03:53.640 --> 03:54.240
OK.

03:54.300 --> 04:00.900
Or if you want to have everything and the rest but the last three then you could go ahead and say all

04:00.900 --> 04:01.830
right minus three.

04:01.830 --> 04:03.990
So it will only give me the.

04:04.170 --> 04:10.740
In this case the first two elements and the last three will not be printed out or not be executed or

04:11.490 --> 04:11.910
returned.

04:11.910 --> 04:14.030
Pretty much all right.

04:14.160 --> 04:22.240
And if you are using zero here you can also just skip to zero so you can just use empty.

04:22.440 --> 04:26.280
Then colon minus three or whatever the second value is.

04:26.280 --> 04:29.470
So if I do that it's the same result as I can see.

04:29.470 --> 04:32.200
All right so that's what you can do with slicing.

04:32.340 --> 04:40.300
Now a pretty cool thing that you also can do with slicing is use this approach with strings.

04:40.680 --> 04:48.630
So I'm going to call that slicing works with strings and let's check it out.

04:48.990 --> 04:52.350
So let's write something like.

04:52.620 --> 04:53.400
Hello world.

04:53.550 --> 05:02.130
So let's just print hello world on the console but now I'm going to slicing so I'm going to use the

05:02.130 --> 05:07.420
square brackets and I'm going to say give me zero to five.

05:07.430 --> 05:14.480
So give me the forced first five characters so this will just give me the first five characters and

05:14.480 --> 05:16.410
it just prints out Hello.

05:16.910 --> 05:23.750
Now if I only want to have the last four characters or maybe last 5 characters I can just enter minus

05:23.750 --> 05:28.420
five colon and that will give me world.

05:28.430 --> 05:34.190
So as you can see start at minus 5 and go towards the end so go towards the end of the string because

05:34.220 --> 05:40.750
if I add something else in here has it going to get the last 5 characters and then it just ends right

05:40.760 --> 05:45.090
because if I get the last five then there is no additional ending right.

05:45.470 --> 05:56.240
OK so that's what we can do with this slicing and with string slicing Moken of course also use the same

05:56.240 --> 06:01.660
approach which just OK from 1 to 3 and that will give me.

06:01.950 --> 06:04.490
And there will be hell from here.

06:04.490 --> 06:06.640
The age is skipped because we had to 1.

06:06.650 --> 06:13.880
So we start at the next one and then we end add index 3 so this second L is not included anymore.

06:14.330 --> 06:16.830
All right so that was List slicing in the next lecture.

06:16.850 --> 06:21.070
There will be a little quiz and afterwards of course the solution for the quiz as well.

06:21.080 --> 06:22.190
So see you there.
