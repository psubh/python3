Come back in this video I would like to add a little menu bar to our application because so far we don't

00:06.420 --> 00:07.030
have one.

00:07.170 --> 00:12.240
And in order to add one you can simply press on type here and just going to call this menu.

00:12.420 --> 00:19.230
And then you see it pops up where you can add some more content So for example I could say do something

00:19.230 --> 00:20.760
like save file.

00:21.450 --> 00:22.110
And there we are.

00:22.110 --> 00:29.600
So now we have this safe file button you could add another possibility here a separator and so forth.

00:29.690 --> 00:32.870
But I'm just going to keep it with the save file for now.

00:33.060 --> 00:38.970
And if you want to know more about it you can check out what it has in terms of actions here checkable

00:39.000 --> 00:41.280
and able and so forth.

00:41.400 --> 00:50.460
And if you want to know what we can do with this object so I'm going to say action file action say file.

00:50.460 --> 00:51.660
That's exactly how it's called.

00:51.660 --> 00:55.950
Actually let me rename it action save file.

00:55.950 --> 01:00.910
I'm going to call this one action save.

01:01.050 --> 01:04.790
So let's rename it to action save like this.

01:05.100 --> 01:07.110
And then you can see the signals that it has.

01:07.110 --> 01:14.190
It has a signal triggered it has the signal changed destroyed so it doesn't have this clicked kind of

01:14.190 --> 01:21.230
thing as the button has but it has this triggered event and that's the one that we are going to use.

01:21.240 --> 01:22.710
So let me get rid of that again.

01:22.740 --> 01:26.340
I just use that in order to show you what the signal is that you can use.

01:26.340 --> 01:34.870
So I'm going to save this window maybe we'll know why I'm going to rerun my built and now let me go

01:34.870 --> 01:39.440
to Maine and just run this real quick and you can see now I have this menu here where I can press a

01:39.440 --> 01:41.230
file of course nothing happens.

01:41.230 --> 01:45.360
But as you can see it's super easy to add this menu to your UI.

01:45.590 --> 01:52.630
And now let me actually add functionality to it and it's super easy to do so we can just say you my

01:52.780 --> 01:55.710
thoughts actions save.

01:55.720 --> 01:58.410
And then we just say triggered it.

01:58.840 --> 02:00.940
So that was the event that we were talking about.

02:00.940 --> 02:01.870
Right.

02:01.870 --> 02:08.130
Triggered connect and here connected to self on safe.

02:08.440 --> 02:12.020
And here again not the call but the actual function name.

02:12.280 --> 02:13.810
Ok now I'm saving it.

02:14.020 --> 02:16.770
And let me run this application again.

02:16.780 --> 02:18.180
Now let me make a change.

02:18.190 --> 02:19.020
This one will be.

02:19.030 --> 02:20.880
Heidi Miller.

02:21.280 --> 02:24.370
And now let me go and save the file.

02:24.400 --> 02:28.270
Let me rerun it and there we are Heidi there.

02:28.550 --> 02:28.790
OK.

02:28.790 --> 02:35.060
Now you can see this ugly text that we get here which is showing me that there is a special character

02:35.300 --> 02:38.370
and that was the thing that I was talking about.

02:38.520 --> 02:45.090
Well with this encoding UTF I do that while I save it but I don't do that when I read the file.

02:45.090 --> 02:50.680
So let me go to read C S V file and add this in here as well.

02:50.690 --> 02:53.740
So the encoding there as well.

02:53.780 --> 03:01.030
Now let me say it again and run it and it's still well and this problem is at that point that it's stored

03:01.030 --> 03:02.200
like this.

03:02.740 --> 03:10.720
So let me start milah once again just to show you me save the file and run it again.

03:10.730 --> 03:12.190
And as you can see now it works.

03:12.190 --> 03:14.480
So now Millo is displayed correctly.

03:14.650 --> 03:15.160
OK.

03:15.340 --> 03:22.180
So you now you see how superpowerful cute creator and PI cube is and how easy it makes our life when

03:22.180 --> 03:25.250
it comes to creating UI and making them intractable.
