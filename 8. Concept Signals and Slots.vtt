Welcome back.

00:01.240 --> 00:08.190
Now that you know how you can drag and drop all of your you eye elements onto your form or onto your

00:08.190 --> 00:13.230
window and you whine it's time to check out how we can interact with those UI in the months and that

00:13.230 --> 00:16.830
is done by signals and slots or with signals and slots.

00:16.860 --> 00:19.050
So let's check out what those signals and slots are.

00:19.050 --> 00:24.250
Well generally the problem is we want to be able to react to user input somehow.

00:24.360 --> 00:29.690
So if the user presses a button or if there's some text we want to be able to interact with it.

00:29.730 --> 00:32.280
We're at least react to that user input.

00:32.640 --> 00:39.060
And when a button is clicked show another item for example so somebody presses something then another

00:39.060 --> 00:47.360
screen pops up or a different tab or something like that and how we do that in cute is we do that with

00:47.380 --> 00:49.130
signals and slots.

00:49.410 --> 00:50.730
And what exactly does that mean.

00:50.730 --> 00:54.040
So what are those signals and slots that you're talking about a..

00:54.090 --> 01:00.570
All right so signals and slots are two different elements which pretty much allow us to interact.

01:00.570 --> 01:04.230
So the signals are sent out by each element.

01:04.230 --> 01:09.320
So for example a button can send its own signal can send a signal.

01:09.570 --> 01:15.330
I was pressed or I was clicked or I was hovered over or something like that.

01:15.840 --> 01:21.530
And in this example if somebody clicked the button then we could do something.

01:21.840 --> 01:28.410
But what we do and what we change let's say in another object is done with slots.

01:28.470 --> 01:31.790
So each element can receive signals via a slot.

01:31.800 --> 01:36.320
So it's pretty much like a receiver and it's waiting for this information.

01:36.330 --> 01:38.900
So you can imagine a button is pressed.

01:38.910 --> 01:45.510
So the signals send out and then somewhere is the receiver who waits for this particular signal and

01:45.510 --> 01:49.270
then it interacts with it or it activates some functionality.

01:49.260 --> 01:51.180
So it's done via a slot.

01:51.180 --> 01:56.390
In this case for example a label has the slot hide which we can hide it with.

01:56.580 --> 02:02.310
So for example if a button is pressed then we could hide a label or if a button is pressed we could

02:02.310 --> 02:05.070
hide a different object on our UI.

02:05.070 --> 02:07.900
So pretty much any UI element can be hidden.

02:08.060 --> 02:09.290
A word can be shown.

02:09.300 --> 02:14.300
So these are the two general methods that we can pretty much use.

02:14.310 --> 02:22.020
So these slots are also Methot so we can call them via Python code but we can also do that in our cute

02:22.050 --> 02:22.780
creator.

02:22.920 --> 02:30.570
So the button is for example the signal clicked preste or the other element is the slot and can be hidden

02:30.660 --> 02:33.410
or can be shown so it can hide or Sjoerd.

02:33.480 --> 02:36.530
So just for user another representation of this.

02:36.660 --> 02:42.480
And if a user clicks then we for example hide the other element as simple as that or we can even hide

02:42.510 --> 02:46.140
elements at the beginning of our UI creation.

02:46.140 --> 02:51.360
So whenever the UI is created we could say okay hide this particular element and then when we press

02:51.390 --> 02:54.870
a button or click a button that we will show this element.

02:54.930 --> 03:01.320
So now we took a look at the principle and let's take a look at this in practice where you can actually

03:01.320 --> 03:03.980
see how this is done in the cube creator.

03:04.110 --> 03:06.890
And later we will see how this is done in code.

03:06.930 --> 03:08.240
So enjoy this video.

03:08.250 --> 03:10.500
Finally some interaction with the UI.

03:10.630 --> 03:16.450
Ant Yeah thats pretty much the basis of any good graphical user interface program right.

03:16.460 --> 03:17.390
So see you there.
