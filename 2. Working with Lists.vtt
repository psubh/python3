00:00.390 --> 00:05.670
All right so let's check out some more functionalities of lists that we haven't touched yet and therefore

00:05.670 --> 00:11.100
I need to create a list and I'm going to create a students list that we were using quite a bit already

00:11.460 --> 00:18.680
and it contains Max than Monica and we had Eric in there.

00:18.690 --> 00:21.580
And finally Francisca.

00:21.840 --> 00:23.980
So until that point nothing you.

00:24.100 --> 00:27.580
But then let's say we want to get rid of the last student.

00:27.660 --> 00:33.700
Well we can just do that with the pop function and you have seen the pop function or pop method already

00:34.530 --> 00:41.720
so we can do something like students that pop that will get rid of Francisco in this case.

00:41.730 --> 00:47.380
But at the same time it will return Francisco to this variable called student.

00:47.490 --> 00:58.780
And now let's just print last student and let's print our students a list and you will see Francisca

00:58.800 --> 01:03.280
now is within law student but she's not within the list anymore.

01:03.570 --> 01:05.550
So that's something that we have seen already.

01:05.670 --> 01:08.140
I just wanted to quickly show you that again.

01:08.310 --> 01:13.940
Now there is another thing that we can do is in order to add an element to our list we could use append

01:14.460 --> 01:20.700
as you have seen before but we also can add a list to each other so I could just say.

01:20.700 --> 01:21.080
All right.

01:21.090 --> 01:30.120
Ed Frank or Ed the list containing one element called Frank to do list and knowledge's print students

01:30.120 --> 01:31.480
once again.

01:32.010 --> 01:34.030
And as you can see makes Monica.

01:34.040 --> 01:38.120
Eric Francisco and Frank are within the list now.

01:38.130 --> 01:44.490
Now in order to delete a student we saw how we can use pop in order to get rid of the last element in

01:44.490 --> 01:45.190
the list.

01:45.250 --> 01:52.950
But now what if we want to get rid of a specific element in the list based on its index then we can

01:52.950 --> 02:00.960
use to Dayle key word DTL in order to delete an element and then we just need to write the name of the

02:00.960 --> 02:05.610
list and then index that we want to get rid of let's say one to get rid of index three.

02:05.910 --> 02:14.700
And now it's print students once again as you can see Francisca which was at index three is not in the

02:14.700 --> 02:15.530
list anymore.

02:15.750 --> 02:18.680
So that's how easy it is to get rid of an element.

02:18.840 --> 02:25.070
But then what if you want to get rid of an element based on it's entry based on the name for example

02:25.080 --> 02:27.170
so let's say we want to get rid of Monica.

02:27.420 --> 02:29.380
Well then we can use to remove method.

02:29.490 --> 02:31.860
So students don't remove.

02:32.250 --> 02:34.830
And here we're just going to say Monica.

02:35.100 --> 02:43.810
And now if we print students once again we will see Monica is not on the list anymore so we simply got

02:43.920 --> 02:48.060
rid of Monica with the Remove method.

02:48.060 --> 02:50.080
All right so that was it for now.

02:50.130 --> 02:56.850
And in the next video we are going to look at slicing So practice around with this a little but some

02:56.850 --> 03:02.470
elements add some new elements create an additional list and add the list to another list and so forth.

03:02.580 --> 03:07.620
Just to get a little feeling for that and otherwise see you in the next video.
