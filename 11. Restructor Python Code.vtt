00:00.590 --> 00:07.570
Come back in this video we are going to clean up our code because what we have here is we have our window

00:07.600 --> 00:15.700
which is a humane window and we then set the title but then we set our YOU window as the main window

00:15.700 --> 00:20.440
which is pretty much our imported main window.

00:20.740 --> 00:28.690
So the one that we've created here which creates Y which has the set up UI function which pretty much

00:28.690 --> 00:34.840
defines the whole set up of the Y where you have the information about where things are positioned where

00:34.840 --> 00:37.460
the UI elements are positioned than those kind of things.

00:37.510 --> 00:44.830
And then after we have this main window we set up the UI window and then we show the UI window and so

00:44.830 --> 00:51.580
forth so that we have pretty much a lot of loose code in here we don't have a cost which we execute

00:51.590 --> 00:54.110
we just have very loose code now.

00:55.130 --> 00:57.810
We can make this a lot cleaner.

00:57.860 --> 01:04.760
So what we can do is we can pretty much say let's go ahead and create a main window class in that main

01:04.760 --> 01:05.390
window class.

01:05.440 --> 01:11.130
It's going to need a cute when it's not two main window.

01:11.240 --> 01:18.500
So we're just going to say OK it's going to inherit from cumen window and that's pretty much what we

01:18.500 --> 01:18.980
have here.

01:18.980 --> 01:26.080
So we inherit from cumen we know what we can go ahead and do not just pass because now code wouldn't

01:26.130 --> 01:28.310
do nothing and we don't have an error here.

01:28.430 --> 01:32.780
But what I actually want to do in here I don't want to pass I don't want to have a constructor here

01:33.110 --> 01:40.610
which will take care of initialization so it will pretty much take care of making my code or my UI look

01:40.610 --> 01:47.960
as I want it to because I want for example to set the window title I want to set a collect functionality

01:47.960 --> 01:50.270
here so I want to connect it with a toggle.

01:50.270 --> 01:52.240
So pretty much what we have done in this line.

01:52.310 --> 01:55.850
I want to set up the UI and all those kind of things.

01:55.850 --> 02:04.670
So what I can do in here is I can just say super dot underscore underscore in it and here I need to

02:04.670 --> 02:06.660
give it to the parent.

02:06.720 --> 02:12.170
So now the parent is going to be empty at that point or it's not known.

02:12.170 --> 02:19.040
So I need to create this parent in here and I will set it to none has a default value.

02:19.220 --> 02:23.890
Now you might say what is this parent thing and why do we need that and so forth.

02:23.900 --> 02:32.460
So if you remember how we created a UI just with Python without a huge creator we just said OK I have

02:32.540 --> 02:38.480
this checkbox I have this window and if I don't put them together I have this button with the the button

02:38.480 --> 02:43.940
example where the button and I have the window and if I don't tell the button that it's supposed to

02:43.940 --> 02:50.440
be inside of the window it's just going to be a specific button floating somewhere on our screen.

02:50.660 --> 02:57.410
So I needed to tell the BOTTEN who his parent was and his parent was the main window and that's pretty

02:57.410 --> 02:58.850
much the same thing that we say here.

02:58.850 --> 03:06.470
So we need to know who our parent is and in which we're what the main window pretty much is going to

03:06.470 --> 03:07.200
be.

03:07.490 --> 03:14.720
And now what we can do is we can set the title in here so instead of saying window that set window title

03:14.750 --> 03:22.280
we can say self that said window title because the window is going to be cumen windows which pretty

03:22.280 --> 03:23.780
much just the same thing right.

03:23.990 --> 03:29.750
So what we now can do is we can just say instead of setting window to qued window widgets queue main

03:29.750 --> 03:36.040
window you just say it's going to be an instance of main window.

03:36.350 --> 03:43.470
Now in order to set the UI we need to actually set the why of self.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.590
To you I underscore main window.

03:46.700 --> 03:47.510
Why is that.

03:47.600 --> 03:50.610
Well it's pretty much in order to get rid of this line here.

03:50.750 --> 03:52.840
So we don't need to do this anymore.

03:52.970 --> 04:00.710
We don't need to do the UI setup any more so we can just say taught you hide that set of UI.

04:01.400 --> 04:03.650
So we just set up the Y in here.

04:03.650 --> 04:10.640
And as you can see now it's expecting a window here and the window that we are passing here is going

04:10.640 --> 04:15.830
to be self because the window itself that we're talking about is the one that we want to pass and we

04:15.830 --> 04:19.880
want to use in general so I can get rid of those two lines now.

04:20.270 --> 04:25.430
And now we only have this one line left where it says clicked connect.

04:25.430 --> 04:35.300
So what I can pretty much do is I can just copy this code from here and say self that you I thought

04:35.300 --> 04:44.500
my button clicked connect and here now it needs to know which button it's talking about.

04:44.500 --> 04:49.120
So self-taught UI thought CB to toggle.

04:49.120 --> 04:52.680
So it's pretty much replacing the code that we had before.

04:52.700 --> 05:01.630
Now the only thing that we have is our very clean class and our main window that we just pass into the

05:01.630 --> 05:04.340
window and then we show the window.

05:05.050 --> 05:07.160
So that's everything we need to do now.

05:07.330 --> 05:13.840
So now what we can do is we can extend our constructor here any time if we want to make any more dustman's

05:13.870 --> 05:16.920
because we cannot do any adjustments in our main window.

05:16.960 --> 05:23.890
Why we can change this UI main window class because if we change it in here then we get a problem because

05:24.270 --> 05:30.430
as it says here warning all changes made in this file will be lost because any time that we change anything

05:30.430 --> 05:36.430
in here and we run our cute creator we save something or change something there and save it and then

05:36.430 --> 05:43.480
we run our build up to in order to compile the UI in order to change to get a main window UI and make

05:43.480 --> 05:50.180
it our main window why file then on changes will be gone.

05:50.230 --> 05:57.680
That's why we now can create our main window which will pretty much say okay I'm going to inherit from

05:57.680 --> 05:59.110
Q main window.

05:59.110 --> 06:06.350
I'm going to pretty much set the main window as my own UI.

06:06.690 --> 06:15.430
And now I can adjust the UI I can call this setup y method I can go ahead and add to Khaliq functionality

06:15.700 --> 06:22.480
and I can go ahead and pretty much do all of my things that I want to adjust and change my UI on my

06:22.480 --> 06:25.850
UI without having to adjust my main window why.

06:25.990 --> 06:29.050
So that's a pretty clean pattern that we have here.

06:29.230 --> 06:37.420
So now we can pretty much make adjustments without having to interfere with cute creator and yet things

06:37.420 --> 06:38.740
will be saved.

06:38.740 --> 06:41.200
Things will be exactly as we want them.

06:41.710 --> 06:47.670
And as you can see the only lines outside of this class is this what we have here is a window window.

06:47.680 --> 06:51.100
Now snowless just run it and see if it's still working.

06:51.100 --> 06:55.590
And as you can see we still get our push button with the check boxes and they still do what they are

06:55.590 --> 06:56.760
supposed to do.

06:57.190 --> 07:03.820
So you see what we had before wasn't working but it was not very extensible or at least was not extensible

07:03.820 --> 07:04.820
in a clean way.

07:04.960 --> 07:10.360
And now we have this very extensible class main window which we can adjust any time and we can even

07:10.360 --> 07:11.500
add functionality in here.

07:11.500 --> 07:17.170
So let's say we would like to add a function in here or a method which should do something we can do

07:17.170 --> 07:23.150
that now because we have this clean class and we're going to check that out in the next video.

07:23.230 --> 07:24.370
So see you there.
