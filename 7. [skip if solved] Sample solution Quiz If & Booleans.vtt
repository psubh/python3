Welcome to the answers for the quiz statement and billions and let's go ahead to the first question

00:06.300 --> 00:10.830
straight away we have this question Is Hello World printed.

00:11.240 --> 00:17.070
And that's the source code so if true and false then print will be executed.

00:17.070 --> 00:25.830
So as you can see we have this condition which says true and false and as and needs to have true on

00:25.830 --> 00:31.000
both sides in order to be true and total This statement is going to be false.

00:31.110 --> 00:35.630
So the statement here is going to be incorrect or it is going to be false.

00:35.700 --> 00:41.740
So the statement will not print this code here or execute this line here.

00:41.760 --> 00:44.750
So the answer to this question is No.

00:45.420 --> 00:48.740
So the correct answer will be B.

00:48.750 --> 00:48.980
All right.

00:48.990 --> 00:50.640
Now let's check out the second one is.

00:50.640 --> 00:51.330
Hello world.

00:51.330 --> 00:52.340
Printed in this case.

00:52.380 --> 00:55.790
If true or false then print Hello world.

00:55.980 --> 00:57.540
So in this case we have.

00:57.540 --> 01:00.210
True or false.

01:00.300 --> 01:05.920
And whenever we have or as a connector only one of the sides has to be true.

01:06.030 --> 01:11.400
So either the left hand side has to be true or the right hand side has to be true in order for the whole

01:11.400 --> 01:13.350
statement to return true.

01:13.530 --> 01:19.980
And as we have one true in here the whole statement is going to be true which means that this code will

01:19.980 --> 01:24.540
be executed which means that the answer is A.

01:25.710 --> 01:26.160
All right.

01:26.190 --> 01:27.240
Now let's check out.

01:27.240 --> 01:33.890
Question number three in order to sign contracts a person must usually be of legal age in most countries

01:33.900 --> 01:35.150
that's 18 years old.

01:35.160 --> 01:38.850
How would you formulate this condition with Python.

01:38.850 --> 01:49.110
Note the difference between less than and less or equal than or greater than and greater or equal than.

01:49.320 --> 01:52.500
Also check the incident where a person is 18 years old.

01:52.500 --> 01:57.900
Mentally in your head even though this might be difficult to put your hands in your head.

01:58.200 --> 02:05.220
All right so let's just check out the potential answers so we have a where age is greater.

02:05.220 --> 02:05.880
18.

02:05.920 --> 02:06.910
Well that means dead.

02:06.930 --> 02:10.530
Age is 19 and any higher number than that.

02:10.590 --> 02:16.460
So this statement is incorrect because a person must be 18 years old or older.

02:16.470 --> 02:23.400
Now let's check out the age is lower or less than 18 and that's of course incorrect because only the

02:23.400 --> 02:25.530
person is older than 18.

02:25.980 --> 02:27.780
Or he can sign a contract.

02:27.880 --> 02:29.230
Then we have C..

02:29.310 --> 02:33.290
Age is greater or equal 18.

02:33.510 --> 02:35.550
And this statement here is the correct answer.

02:35.550 --> 02:36.390
Why is that.

02:36.450 --> 02:42.020
Because here we include every higher number than 18 and 18.

02:42.090 --> 02:45.760
It itself as well so we have 18 and higher.

02:45.810 --> 02:47.400
Which is exactly what we wanted.

02:47.400 --> 02:50.750
So a person has to be 18 years old or older.

02:51.090 --> 02:56.520
And then we have this age less than equal 18.

02:56.520 --> 03:01.250
While it's correct for the 18 itself it's incorrect for less then.

03:01.350 --> 03:07.770
Now you could of course argue this statement here in order to sign contracts and must a person must

03:07.770 --> 03:15.800
usually be of legal age 18 years old that is already pretty tricky because this year would just say

03:15.940 --> 03:19.200
that is it that the person has to be exactly 18 years old.

03:19.290 --> 03:24.810
So none of the answers would be correct but a person has to be at least 18 years old.

03:25.020 --> 03:28.420
So the correct answer is going to be c..

03:28.920 --> 03:34.170
I hope you could answer those questions easily and if not I hope you understood what I just explained.

03:34.170 --> 03:37.650
And then in the next we we're going to check out the in operator.

03:37.680 --> 03:39.320
So see you there.
