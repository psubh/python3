Welcome back in this video we are going to look into the pop function which allows us to remove the

00:06.750 --> 00:08.730
last item in a list.

00:08.730 --> 00:14.910
Therefore I have this list prepared here called planets and in there you have the nine planets that

00:15.180 --> 00:21.900
are within our solar system and Pluto is in there as well as I think it was decided that Pluto is a

00:21.900 --> 00:22.580
planet.

00:22.620 --> 00:28.050
In the end so they weren't sure for quite a while so they said it wasn't not but in the end it is a

00:28.050 --> 00:28.530
planet.

00:28.620 --> 00:30.920
At least that's the latest decision.

00:30.930 --> 00:36.400
So now if I want to get rid of the last element there is something called Pop and that's just used this

00:36.410 --> 00:37.460
pop function.

00:37.560 --> 00:40.700
And I'm going to just say planets that pop.

00:40.980 --> 00:48.300
And what that will do is it will delete Pluto from this list so let's just try it out.

00:48.620 --> 00:49.360
Let's run the code.

00:49.380 --> 00:51.990
And as you can see Pluto is not in the list anymore.

00:52.020 --> 00:57.150
So Mercury Venus Earth and so forth are all there but Pluto is not there.

00:57.150 --> 00:59.050
So where did you go.

00:59.250 --> 01:01.760
Well it got deleted from the list.

01:01.770 --> 01:07.220
But at the same time it is the output of this approach here.

01:07.230 --> 01:13.260
So this function or this code it gives us the output how do we test that.

01:13.260 --> 01:14.680
Well let me show you real quick.

01:14.970 --> 01:19.690
So we create a new cell where we have all of this code again.

01:19.890 --> 01:28.410
And now instead of just calling this pop function in this line I'm going to create a variable that will

01:28.680 --> 01:30.630
store the result of that.

01:30.630 --> 01:39.570
So the result of this or the output or the return of this approach shared list name that pop is going

01:39.570 --> 01:41.100
to be Pluto.

01:41.460 --> 01:42.740
And how do we check that.

01:42.750 --> 01:43.930
Well let's just do that.

01:44.010 --> 01:48.500
Let's add a line here which is going to print.

01:48.660 --> 01:53.240
So print P and let's run the code again.

01:53.250 --> 02:01.020
And as you can see now it says Pluto and that is because P contains Pluto now it contains the thing

02:01.020 --> 02:03.130
that was popped from the list.

02:03.180 --> 02:10.140
So let's say we create another line and we call that P2 it's going to be planets that pop once again

02:11.430 --> 02:18.930
and we print P2 onto the screen and you see Pluto and Neptune.

02:18.930 --> 02:27.300
So the list is going to get smaller and at the same time we store the output of that pop.

02:27.540 --> 02:34.320
And you could use that in plenty of approaches or situations where you have for example the last in

02:34.380 --> 02:38.840
first out approach where are you a pen something to the list.

02:38.850 --> 02:46.980
Then you take it out again because Mercury's way too far within our solar system are too close to the

02:47.340 --> 02:54.690
sun and we're always on we take the last one from the list so we could just use pop in order to do that

02:55.020 --> 02:57.870
and we could clean up the planets one by one.

02:57.870 --> 03:02.730
And of course plenty of other approaches as well and we will use that quite a bit as well.

03:02.730 --> 03:03.220
All right.

03:03.360 --> 03:08.670
So in the next lecture you will find a little sheet containing some information about the list and Piven

03:09.030 --> 03:14.440
and afterwards we're going to check how to convert data in Python.

03:14.460 --> 03:15.670
So see you there.
