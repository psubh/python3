00:00.060 --> 00:06.900
Well come back in this video we are going to use another little module that will help us by joining

00:06.900 --> 00:07.730
you or else.

00:07.740 --> 00:09.170
And why do we need that.

00:09.390 --> 00:12.930
Well there is one little problem with our images.

00:12.960 --> 00:17.740
So let me just print image here real quick and execute the code.

00:17.850 --> 00:24.550
You will see that we get this link which says dot and then slash and slash one dot EPG.

00:24.570 --> 00:30.510
What that means is on the route of the website I'm just calling from there on.

00:30.510 --> 00:32.590
Just add this piece of link.

00:32.880 --> 00:35.680
So if we take this link here.

00:35.730 --> 00:42.390
So we have this link and well it's pretty much the link that we have here in order to access this Web

00:42.390 --> 00:43.270
site.

00:43.320 --> 00:47.790
So this dot means that we take away this index that ph.

00:48.030 --> 00:51.500
And then we add this piece here to the link.

00:51.540 --> 00:56.210
So if we now add that to the link at the end I mean get rid of one slash.

00:56.400 --> 00:58.620
Then I get this image here.

00:58.650 --> 01:01.620
So what we're currently having is just the relative link.

01:01.890 --> 01:07.570
And most of the times you would rather have the complete link which pretty much is what we have here.

01:07.590 --> 01:12.480
So that's the complete link or the location of this image.

01:12.480 --> 01:19.940
So in order to get that we need to use something called u r l library or you ad lib.

01:20.190 --> 01:30.210
So I'm going to import it up here so I'm just going to say from you are l lib that parse import to u

01:30.270 --> 01:31.710
r l joint.

01:32.000 --> 01:39.710
Well that will give me is the u r l joint function or method which I then can use in order to join you

01:39.710 --> 01:40.350
or else.

01:40.590 --> 01:41.490
And how do I do that.

01:41.490 --> 01:44.550
Well I can simply use the following approach.

01:44.550 --> 01:51.980
I can just say you are l join and then here I need to add the two things that I would like to join.

01:52.140 --> 01:53.820
So let's say I have this link here.

01:53.820 --> 01:58.440
So that's going to be the complete link of the Web sites that I'm calling.

01:58.440 --> 02:05.310
So let's say I have my u r l which is going to be that piece here which just needs to be a string OK.

02:05.550 --> 02:09.020
So I have this Eurail and I'm going to join that.

02:09.030 --> 02:17.720
You are now with my relative link which is this piece here so this slash I'm just Lesch one cheap.

02:17.940 --> 02:24.780
Because if you look at it from here we can see that it's opened up a card BLOCK And let's look at the

02:24.780 --> 02:25.080
image.

02:25.080 --> 02:26.450
So this is the image.

02:26.610 --> 02:33.990
And it just gives me this relative links so this slash slash one that JP g it doesn't give me the whole

02:34.000 --> 02:37.510
link and that's what we have gotten and we would now like to join it.

02:37.530 --> 02:42.210
And well pretty much that's what this whole you are I'll join is for.

02:42.360 --> 02:45.200
So here we need to give the relative link.

02:45.330 --> 02:50.130
So let's just for testing purposes copy this here.

02:50.160 --> 02:57.230
This piece of link and just added in there I can.

02:57.270 --> 03:01.030
So now let's print this.

03:01.030 --> 03:02.210
You are out.

03:02.340 --> 03:08.070
So Joyent you were all going to be your I'll join.

03:08.460 --> 03:09.690
And let me print that out.

03:09.690 --> 03:12.460
So let me execute the code.

03:12.950 --> 03:14.810
And as you can see that's the whole thing.

03:14.810 --> 03:17.060
So I'm getting the complete link here.

03:17.490 --> 03:22.830
That's exactly what I would like to store within my Crawl article object.

03:22.830 --> 03:28.390
So I wouldn't like to store the relative length of the image I would like to store the complete link.

03:28.530 --> 03:30.200
So the absolute link pretty much.

03:30.210 --> 03:30.810
OK.

03:31.020 --> 03:36.990
So what we need to do now is instead of putting it up pop here we need to find a good position where

03:36.990 --> 03:38.260
we want to use that.

03:38.490 --> 03:44.310
And a good position where we want to have the URL for example would be in our article fetcher right

03:44.310 --> 03:50.220
here because this Eurail now we can use it and just added in here.

03:50.220 --> 03:56.910
So that this request that get method will just take this Eurail So nothing has changed pretty much except

03:56.910 --> 04:03.420
that we are saying OK take the variable that contains the same value that we were using before and now

04:03.690 --> 04:05.330
where do we want to join.

04:05.340 --> 04:09.230
So we're not going to need the print statement anymore but we want to join it.

04:09.240 --> 04:10.520
And where is that.

04:10.530 --> 04:19.950
Well we want to join it at this image area and in order to join it correctly we can use multiple ways.

04:19.950 --> 04:29.130
But the best way will be to use this URL join here with the user L and this piece here because that

04:29.130 --> 04:35.980
piece here that is marked right now is actually giving me this relative link that we have.

04:36.180 --> 04:38.920
So it gives me this one and that one and so forth.

04:39.090 --> 04:44.430
So now I can just say OK use it like so.

04:45.180 --> 04:50.720
So joinder you IRL with the relative link and then store that within image.

04:50.760 --> 04:57.870
And now if we execute the code once again we will have all of the actual links so the absolute links

04:57.870 --> 05:00.380
instead of the relative links.

05:00.410 --> 05:04.830
Now you can open them in the new tab and you can see OK that's image number two.

05:05.040 --> 05:05.710
So let's see.

05:05.710 --> 05:07.330
All right that's image number.

05:07.560 --> 05:08.720
Perfect.

05:08.760 --> 05:09.770
So there we are.

05:09.930 --> 05:17.790
That's what this you were l library Parr's import you are join gives us and I'm going to cut this line

05:17.790 --> 05:21.430
out there where that was pretty much it.

05:21.450 --> 05:32.090
I just wanted to show you another pretty cool feature that we can use from Python by using a other module.

05:32.100 --> 05:34.240
So there you see the power of modules.

05:34.260 --> 05:39.360
So we don't need to write all of this stuff because it already knows it by itself and we can just go

05:39.360 --> 05:41.010
ahead and use it.
