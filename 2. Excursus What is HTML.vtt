00:00.120 --> 00:00.840
Come back.

00:00.840 --> 00:03.250
In this video we are going to check out H-2 email.

00:03.270 --> 00:08.910
And if you know HDMI already then you can just get this video and we're just going to have a quick look

00:08.910 --> 00:14.150
at the very basics of aged him male and female as a script language.

00:14.160 --> 00:21.040
It's not a programming language and it really is therefore creating a structure of a website so a web

00:21.040 --> 00:27.240
site is structured in a certain way and how it is structured is defined with age to e-mail.

00:27.270 --> 00:34.170
So there is a folder HVM out in the right crawler folder and in here I'm going to create a new file

00:34.170 --> 00:41.300
so it's just going to be a text file and I'm going to call that one index that aged female index aged

00:41.570 --> 00:48.120
aged female is the starting age female files of and that's the one that usually comes up when you go

00:48.120 --> 00:54.930
to the front first page of the website so the main domain or front page like Google dot com.

00:54.970 --> 00:57.890
There you have it will be in this age e-mail.

00:58.050 --> 01:04.800
All right so how does age you may look like well an age HMO generally what you have is something called

01:04.820 --> 01:05.530
tags.

01:05.700 --> 01:10.800
So you structure your code in tags or your content in tags.

01:10.800 --> 01:17.400
So for example you have this tag which you open with a less than sign and you close it with a greater

01:17.430 --> 01:17.960
sign.

01:18.090 --> 01:19.870
And that's the case for all tags.

01:19.890 --> 01:22.430
So that's how you have this tag.

01:22.590 --> 01:27.420
And then you have this as an opening tag but then you also have a closing tag.

01:27.570 --> 01:32.640
So a tag is always consisting of two parts.

01:32.640 --> 01:35.180
So this is the opening one and this is the closing one.

01:35.310 --> 01:42.930
So the only difference here is that you use a slash here just before the word or the letter that indicates

01:42.930 --> 01:44.490
what kind of tag does this.

01:44.490 --> 01:48.460
So this here is a p tag which stands for paragraph.

01:48.540 --> 01:57.800
So I can create a paragraph here something like I am content as a paragraph just as an example.

01:57.990 --> 02:04.980
So if I say now save this file I can open it up and I will be able to open it up in a browser.

02:05.220 --> 02:14.260
So if I go into my finder and I go back to the course material and in here to the crawler one is here

02:14.280 --> 02:20.310
right a crawler and then in the HDD folder you will find this HDMI file and you can open it for example

02:20.610 --> 02:22.170
with Google Chrome.

02:22.170 --> 02:27.510
Now as you can see it just says I'm concerned as a paragraph and that's pretty much it.

02:27.510 --> 02:29.960
So that's the code we just developed here.

02:30.120 --> 02:37.170
So nothing too fancy but this is not just a text that doesn't display as you can see it doesn't display

02:37.170 --> 02:37.990
this.

02:38.350 --> 02:43.700
And if you want to see the source code you can always right click and then inspect it.

02:43.710 --> 02:49.690
So if you inspect then you see here on the elements you see what this code looks like.

02:49.690 --> 02:58.920
And even though I just had added this P-TECH in here as you can see there is an H M L tag a head take

02:58.920 --> 03:06.190
a body tag and then within the body tag we have this P-TECH which says I am content as a paragraph.

03:06.430 --> 03:07.170
Right.

03:07.230 --> 03:10.340
So that's pretty much generally the structure.

03:10.340 --> 03:13.960
So you have a P-TECH that's create another p tag.

03:14.400 --> 03:17.450
And then I'm going to put it at the bottom or just below it.

03:17.550 --> 03:25.790
And what that is it's just going to be another paragraph so I can add something like I am the.

03:25.890 --> 03:28.080
Or any other paragraph.

03:28.080 --> 03:36.120
So if I saved that file and I then refreshed this side as you can see I am another paragraph is displayed

03:36.120 --> 03:39.430
here and it's part of the body tag.

03:39.660 --> 03:44.200
So that is generally how you have the structure of an aged female file.

03:44.340 --> 03:47.620
Let's just reproduce that here so we have this team.

03:47.640 --> 03:50.620
I'll tag and at one point it has to close.

03:50.640 --> 03:52.590
So I'm closing the page to him.

03:52.590 --> 03:57.360
I'll take as I usually would close other text as well.

03:57.360 --> 04:04.270
And now all the age HTML code is within those two tags so this code here has to go right in here.

04:04.630 --> 04:06.320
Then there is something else missing.

04:06.480 --> 04:17.310
You usually also have a head tag where you add meta information for example or you have your C S S file

04:17.310 --> 04:21.120
which and which stores how stuff is displayed.

04:21.120 --> 04:26.110
So for example should this be colored in red or should it be colored and black or whatever.

04:26.310 --> 04:35.340
And then you have the body so the body contains all of the information that is displayed on the screen.

04:35.340 --> 04:38.280
So this is going to be where my betakes go.

04:38.490 --> 04:46.020
So now I'm going to cut them all right in here and it really makes sense to use indents here as well.

04:46.020 --> 04:51.180
It's not necessary in the sense that it won't work or it will still work even if you don't have the

04:51.180 --> 04:51.710
indents.

04:51.840 --> 04:55.220
But it's a lot easier to read if you have this structure.

04:55.560 --> 05:02.480
OK so I have this head tag I have this tag and within the body tag I have all of my content.

05:02.660 --> 05:07.090
So I'm going to save that file again and I'm going to refresh here.

05:07.100 --> 05:12.140
And as you see nothing has changed even though I have just added all of the structure but that's because

05:12.830 --> 05:18.860
our modern browsers they already know OK if you have a file which is an aged him file and there is a

05:18.860 --> 05:20.010
p tag in there.

05:20.150 --> 05:26.660
Well it doesn't need all of this additional stuff like aged female body and so forth in order to understand

05:26.660 --> 05:30.280
that this is the structure that is going to need.

05:30.440 --> 05:32.430
So does that automatically for us.

05:32.450 --> 05:34.320
Or did that automatically for us.

05:34.370 --> 05:39.590
But we of course need to understand that that's the structure of the Web site and if we want to build

05:39.590 --> 05:44.570
it correctly then of course we need to use these things here as well.

05:44.810 --> 05:48.250
So these tags like the shemale tag and so forth.

05:49.520 --> 05:52.590
All right so that was the general introduction.

05:52.610 --> 05:55.360
There is one more thing that I would like to show you real quick.

05:55.370 --> 06:03.580
You can even change some minor aspects of your pretax For example I could add a strong here.

06:03.790 --> 06:13.940
What that will do is it will make everything that is within its strong tag thick so it will make it

06:13.940 --> 06:14.540
strong.

06:14.540 --> 06:17.490
So let me really run it as you can see now.

06:17.690 --> 06:22.010
This is written as a bold character.

06:22.100 --> 06:28.430
So the whole sentence is boiled down all right and that's what the strong does.

06:29.210 --> 06:34.490
So there's another tag and we're going to look at multiple tags and go to check out how a web site is

06:34.490 --> 06:40.610
structured in order to understand better how to crawl it and how to get the data that we actually need.

06:40.850 --> 06:46.320
All right so I'd say See you in the next video where we will get HDMI code from a side.

06:46.400 --> 06:47.510
So see you there.
