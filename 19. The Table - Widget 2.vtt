00:00.320 --> 00:01.380
Work come back.

00:01.380 --> 00:05.340
We have our little program which is a table program.

00:05.340 --> 00:07.390
It's almost as good as axil.

00:07.560 --> 00:15.270
Well not barely or not not even close but what we will add in this video is how to pretty much add a

00:15.270 --> 00:22.380
row in here by pressing this button and we will check out how to do that correctly so let's go ahead

00:22.410 --> 00:26.370
and start with just creating it in general.

00:26.370 --> 00:31.560
So let's just say we want to add a road to our table widget.

00:31.580 --> 00:36.550
And the cool thing is there is a very simple method here called insert row.

00:36.690 --> 00:39.310
And as you can see there's also something called insert column.

00:39.450 --> 00:43.760
But let's just start with insert row as you can see it expects an int.

00:43.770 --> 00:47.890
So let's just say OK well if you expect and then I'm just going to give you zero.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.240
So let's save this file and run it again and push the button.

00:52.320 --> 00:58.880
And as you can see suddenly we have this additional entry and actually with me comment those two out

00:58.890 --> 01:05.310
because it's confusing a little bit and it's wrong and again I press a button and as you can see now

01:05.310 --> 01:08.770
it has added a row and I press it again.

01:08.790 --> 01:11.910
And as you can see it's adding rows all the time.

01:12.090 --> 01:18.990
So each time I press a button it adds a row can add some text high and some number.

01:19.170 --> 01:24.680
And as you can see it always adds it below it can.

01:24.720 --> 01:27.450
So now we have this little issue.

01:27.450 --> 01:30.490
How do we enter the proper value.

01:30.570 --> 01:34.510
So we're adding value to because we have two entries right.

01:34.560 --> 01:37.690
So why don't we say insert ero after the second one.

01:37.700 --> 01:38.590
All right perfect.

01:38.820 --> 01:40.450
That's exactly what I wanted.

01:40.470 --> 01:42.250
So let me add some text in here.

01:42.250 --> 01:47.470
Let's say New York and it has a gazillion inhabitants.

01:47.670 --> 01:51.630
And then I want to add another row sort of impressive again on them.

01:51.750 --> 01:53.070
That's not what I wanted.

01:53.070 --> 01:54.780
Why is it like that.

01:54.810 --> 01:59.070
Why is there a you in here I want to test it in the bottom of it.

01:59.280 --> 02:02.860
Well let's add some text in here again.

02:03.090 --> 02:05.060
Press the button and again.

02:05.180 --> 02:05.530
So.

02:05.610 --> 02:09.960
Always putting it adds value to and as you know it starts with zero.

02:09.980 --> 02:13.690
So 0 1 and then to it inserts the rope.

02:13.710 --> 02:18.540
So that's why it's always going to be inserted here off to Berlin in this case.

02:18.580 --> 02:25.880
Now if I want to make sure that it always is at the end I need to create a workaround.

02:26.130 --> 02:29.290
So let's say I just want to see how many rows there are.

02:29.550 --> 02:37.840
Well there is a variable Actually there is a property but we can get that property by using the method.

02:38.070 --> 02:41.450
And that is called RHO count.

02:41.700 --> 02:47.650
So RHO count will give us the value of how many rows there are in our table widget.

02:48.360 --> 02:51.690
So let me run that again and run it.

02:51.690 --> 02:54.960
We can see we get two as the result.

02:54.960 --> 02:59.650
So let me press the button again get three at four.

02:59.670 --> 03:05.680
So it's telling us the value just before it inserts the row OK.

03:06.020 --> 03:14.360
So what we could do is pretty much say OK check out how many rows there are and then just put it below

03:14.480 --> 03:16.170
the amount of rows that we have.

03:16.400 --> 03:18.750
All right so how would we do that.

03:18.890 --> 03:22.070
So I could just say use the rockhound here.

03:22.890 --> 03:31.040
For answered Rob so I'm just going to copy this code here and I'm going to replace the two with it.

03:31.090 --> 03:32.920
So let's test this again.

03:33.020 --> 03:33.810
Stop the code.

03:33.820 --> 03:35.410
Run it again.

03:35.470 --> 03:36.650
Now let's see what happens.

03:36.670 --> 03:39.930
OK so now we have this new line that looks good.

03:39.930 --> 03:49.350
I'm going to answer something here like New York and it has an a big amount of number or values or inhabitants.

03:49.450 --> 03:51.720
Each inhabitant is a value now.

03:51.970 --> 03:59.680
So we have this very cryptic number which is a city somewhere on a different planet and it has this

03:59.680 --> 04:01.080
amount of inhabitants.

04:01.210 --> 04:04.880
But as you can see now it adds a row just below.

04:05.020 --> 04:06.900
And that's exactly what we would expect.

04:06.910 --> 04:11.760
And what we would want right now as can see now I can scroll here.

04:11.980 --> 04:19.420
So it's taken care of already so scrolling is already perfectly taken care of our cute table widget

04:19.510 --> 04:25.360
as it can see the tail widget has a scroll button or scroll bar once there are too many rows to display

04:25.390 --> 04:28.680
on the size of the window that we have here.

04:29.080 --> 04:34.570
So what if I would like to have values in there so I don't want it to be an empty entry each time I

04:34.570 --> 04:35.020
press.

04:35.020 --> 04:37.470
But I want there to be some values.

04:37.690 --> 04:49.390
Well I can for example very easily say OK Ed Budapest at road 2 and column 0 and the inhabitants amount

04:49.550 --> 04:52.390
at the same row and column 1.

04:52.390 --> 04:57.490
So let's run that again and let's press the button and while perfect that's exactly what I wanted.

04:57.490 --> 05:01.140
But what happens if I press again call them doesn't work.

05:01.300 --> 05:07.770
So I would like to have let's say a default value here or a random value or something like that then.

05:08.010 --> 05:10.310
Well this approach doesn't seem to work.

05:10.630 --> 05:12.030
But how do we fix that.

05:12.280 --> 05:19.000
Well the problem is that I'm using a fixed value here so I'm using a value of two but I actually should

05:19.000 --> 05:21.160
use a different value in here.

05:21.160 --> 05:27.960
Now of course I could say OK added the same row that you have added this new row.

05:27.970 --> 05:30.820
So we know that it's at row count right.

05:30.970 --> 05:36.790
So we could of course go ahead and copy and paste this rockhound in there but that's a little bit difficult

05:36.790 --> 05:43.090
to read afterwards so the better choice would be to say OK I want to store that in a variable called

05:43.090 --> 05:45.540
row count or just row.

05:45.670 --> 05:52.380
We could call the roll we could roll call the road count and instead of using this whole text in here

05:52.420 --> 06:01.270
I'm just going to use the row because it's the same value right and the same for this row and the same

06:01.270 --> 06:03.440
for the road down here.

06:03.790 --> 06:10.720
So now it's just going to add Budapest's with a value for each new entry that we've created.

06:10.720 --> 06:12.090
So let me test that.

06:12.370 --> 06:18.240
And as you can see we get Budapest's oppress again we get Budapest and so forth.

06:18.280 --> 06:26.260
So each time we press the button we add any row and that new row is being added at the bottom and it

06:26.290 --> 06:32.870
automatically gets a specific text that we have defined for column 0 and column 1.

06:33.100 --> 06:40.120
And in general we have to be very careful here again because as you know Python and any programming

06:40.120 --> 06:42.640
language in general they start counting at zero.

06:42.700 --> 06:44.080
Not like we humans.

06:44.380 --> 06:46.520
We start with one.

06:46.600 --> 06:49.940
But what programming languages and computers start with zero.

06:50.050 --> 06:54.040
So that's something that we have to be very careful and very wary about.

06:54.040 --> 07:01.840
All right so now you know how to add additional rows how to enter values into those rows in a whole

07:01.840 --> 07:08.030
table widget and so forth and yet say that's it for this video and see you in the next one.
