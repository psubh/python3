00:00.780 --> 00:03.690
Come to the solution for the quiz lists.

00:03.840 --> 00:09.180
So let's start with the first question which letter outputs the following program and as it can see

00:09.180 --> 00:17.340
print hello world and then slicing minus two or in square brackets minus to what minus two does.

00:17.460 --> 00:21.870
It says I would like to only take it the second to last letter.

00:21.870 --> 00:24.160
So if there was minus one we would get D.

00:24.450 --> 00:26.990
If there is minus two we get L.

00:27.060 --> 00:29.570
So the correct answer here is B.

00:29.970 --> 00:32.270
So the right solution B.

00:33.300 --> 00:40.140
If you use the square brackets and then a number in here then you tell the string here that you only

00:40.150 --> 00:44.400
want to have a particular character because we're not using colon here.

00:44.410 --> 00:47.240
There's no colon so we're not slicing it in parts.

00:47.240 --> 00:50.030
We're just getting one particular character here.

00:50.250 --> 00:53.210
And the one we get is minus two.

00:53.370 --> 00:58.440
So we just have to look at the string from the back or from the end.

00:58.530 --> 01:04.040
So D minus 1 and L minus 2 are would be minus 3 and so forth.

01:04.050 --> 01:08.200
Then Question number two what does the following program output print.

01:08.210 --> 01:11.560
John Doe minus three colon nothing.

01:11.820 --> 01:20.220
So this minus three means that it starts at minus three and minus three is the third last character.

01:20.220 --> 01:25.200
So if we look at the string Jondo then it starts this D.

01:25.590 --> 01:27.810
And after the cold and there's nothing else left.

01:27.810 --> 01:32.430
So this means that we will get the rest of the string.

01:32.430 --> 01:36.170
So we start at minus three and we get the rest of the string.

01:36.180 --> 01:38.060
So what we get is though.

01:38.250 --> 01:46.990
So the correct answer here will be D as we get dough from Jondo so solution is D.

01:47.070 --> 01:49.190
Now let's look at question number three.

01:49.470 --> 01:51.870
What does the following program output.

01:51.870 --> 01:53.600
Now we have it the other way around.

01:53.610 --> 01:56.420
So before the colon there's nothing.

01:56.430 --> 01:57.540
So we start.

01:57.660 --> 02:04.670
Zero which means we start at the beginning and then it says up to the point of minus three.

02:04.740 --> 02:06.160
Not Included.

02:06.420 --> 02:08.400
So the minus 3 is not included.

02:08.400 --> 02:12.050
So we don't get the third last character in there.

02:12.330 --> 02:15.740
Which means though is not going to be or D is not going to be part.

02:15.870 --> 02:19.030
So we only get John.

02:19.230 --> 02:22.150
So the answer is C here.

02:23.130 --> 02:26.870
All right so correct solution is going to be c.

02:27.390 --> 02:29.670
Now let's have a look at question number four.

02:29.850 --> 02:31.950
What does the following program output.

02:31.950 --> 02:32.400
We have.

02:32.400 --> 02:33.560
Hello world.

02:34.020 --> 02:40.870
Starting at the sixth character and going until the last but not including.

02:41.080 --> 02:48.520
So colon minus 1 means take the last one but then exclude that.

02:48.720 --> 02:52.550
So it would give us WHY DO I SAY world here.

02:52.560 --> 03:00.420
Well the answer is world which is B and that is because if we look at the six or six we mean the sixth

03:00.480 --> 03:04.740
index which means the sixth character and starting to count a zero.

03:04.740 --> 03:08.880
So 0 1 2 3 4.

03:09.030 --> 03:17.850
The empty space is 5 and W6 So we start at W and then we go all the way to minus one excluded and minus

03:17.850 --> 03:18.200
1.

03:18.210 --> 03:22.130
Is this exclamation mark here.

03:22.140 --> 03:28.800
So the estimation markers excluded which means we have the whole world we're word that we're taking.

03:28.800 --> 03:32.170
So the answer is B world.

03:33.310 --> 03:34.110
All right.

03:34.320 --> 03:40.830
So I hope you could follow along and I hope you understand the concept of slicing and also of playing

03:40.830 --> 03:46.690
around with strings and in the next we we're going to check out a list comprehension.

03:46.710 --> 03:47.730
So see you there.
