Come back in this video we're going to check out the NOT operator.

00:04.260 --> 00:07.070
And we will see multiple versions of it.

00:07.070 --> 00:13.790
So let's create a not age creator equal 30.

00:13.800 --> 00:15.770
So you can go ahead and do it like that.

00:15.780 --> 00:21.120
You can just say OK executed and just run it.

00:21.230 --> 00:26.140
And as you can see it's executed because the age is not greater equal 30.

00:26.700 --> 00:34.260
But of course this is not very efficient because first Python checks this code here and then it negates

00:34.260 --> 00:37.910
it and then it checks whether that the whole statement is true.

00:37.920 --> 00:46.530
So you could of course do a lot a lot faster but just saying if age lower 30 or less than 30 and then

00:46.530 --> 00:51.960
just print the same thing here executed as you can see both are executed.

00:51.960 --> 00:56.820
So this if statement would be a lot more efficient than that one.

00:56.820 --> 01:02.690
Not just in tabs in terms of typing but also in terms of processing power and speed.

01:02.760 --> 01:07.320
So you can use the not operator it just negates the whole thing.

01:07.320 --> 01:10.790
And in this case it really doesn't make that much sense.

01:10.800 --> 01:13.170
But I wanted to show you that it's possible.

01:13.500 --> 01:16.370
Then there are cases where it actually makes a lot more sense.

01:16.380 --> 01:27.990
And that's if we say have a little list with Macs and Nadine and now I want to check if Maurits or let's

01:27.990 --> 01:32.610
say Moe is not in names.

01:32.880 --> 01:38.030
So what I'm checking now is Moe not part of the names list.

01:38.130 --> 01:46.980
And if that's true then let's just say something like Moe is not in the list so let's print that.

01:46.980 --> 01:51.700
And as you can see or executed you can see what was not in the list.

01:51.700 --> 02:02.670
Now we can of course do the same thing and a different approach where we can just say if not mo in names

02:03.720 --> 02:05.930
and we can print them again.

02:06.420 --> 02:07.200
Same thing.

02:07.200 --> 02:09.450
Moe is not in the list.

02:09.450 --> 02:12.330
And as you can see it's executed as well.

02:12.390 --> 02:21.630
So both versions are fine but not in this version here is nicer where is prettier to look at and also

02:21.630 --> 02:27.530
easier to to guess what's going on or to understand what's going on because here we see it is not.

02:27.570 --> 02:29.430
And then we see this in nature.

02:29.430 --> 02:34.440
So here we see both in one line and it's easier to read is more.

02:34.470 --> 02:36.350
Not in the list names.

02:36.390 --> 02:39.320
And if that is true then please print that statement.

02:39.540 --> 02:49.320
And here we say if not Mo is in names so everyone else but more in names pretty much then print the

02:49.320 --> 02:50.070
statement as well.

02:50.070 --> 02:58.100
It's the same thing as this one here but it's as I said not that easy to read and not that well written

02:58.110 --> 03:03.810
I'd say so highly preferred is this version here.

03:04.230 --> 03:10.470
So the only thing that you really need is NOT operator for is really true to just quickly negate whatever

03:10.470 --> 03:11.480
you're checking.

03:11.490 --> 03:18.900
So of course you could have gone ahead and done something like if Moe

03:21.510 --> 03:25.030
in names then print something.

03:25.080 --> 03:30.330
Moe is a name is always there and else

03:32.620 --> 03:34.950
print most.

03:34.950 --> 03:36.430
Not in the list.

03:36.620 --> 03:38.690
Of course he could have gone ahead like this.

03:39.030 --> 03:44.850
But if you just want to check if somebody is not in their job to just check the negated version first

03:44.940 --> 03:47.860
then this statement is going to be better.

03:47.910 --> 03:54.360
And by way that something that I haven't covered yet and I will look into even closer when we go to

03:54.360 --> 03:55.090
the live.

03:55.260 --> 04:02.400
But whenever you have this if statement and the if statement is true the whole else statement will never

04:02.400 --> 04:05.760
be checked so it won't even be thought about.

04:05.760 --> 04:12.000
So the code will just go order the cursor will go here if no names.

04:12.030 --> 04:14.850
If that statement is true then it will go here.

04:15.120 --> 04:19.410
And then it will straight away jump to the line here.

04:19.410 --> 04:25.650
So to this line where I'm out with my cursor right now with my mouse so I'll just skip the whole thing.

04:25.650 --> 04:26.240
All right.

04:26.270 --> 04:28.930
And that will make a lot more sense as soon as we get to live.

04:29.040 --> 04:36.370
So see you in the next video where we have a little quiz or actually a little sheet followed followed

04:36.390 --> 04:38.890
by a question of course the answers to the quiz.

04:38.970 --> 04:40.580
So have fun doing that.

04:40.620 --> 04:41.920
And see you there.
