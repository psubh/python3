Come back in this video I would like to quickly go through the answers of the last quiz.

00:04.920 --> 00:11.610
So the first Tasco question was How do you integrate Pender's module and you have a which says import

00:11.610 --> 00:19.740
Pender's penetrate import import Pena's from zoo and import pandas but with plenty of underscores surrounding

00:19.740 --> 00:20.130
it.

00:20.340 --> 00:21.820
So the correct answer is A.

00:21.840 --> 00:23.220
Import pandas.

00:23.340 --> 00:29.790
And if we look at the other possible answers so Panoz that import that we're called the import function

00:29.850 --> 00:38.340
from the pondus module then import Ponder's from zoo that would import the Pender's module which is

00:38.340 --> 00:40.480
a part module from the zoo.

00:40.560 --> 00:47.420
So that's not specifically what we want and I want is a chance some jibberish doesn't make sense.

00:47.640 --> 00:49.500
So let's have a look at tusked too.

00:49.530 --> 00:55.240
How do you call the readout or root underscores C is the function from the pandas module.

00:55.350 --> 01:00.120
After you have included the whole module with the import function.

01:00.420 --> 01:05.840
Ok so we have the whole module that contains this Ponder's read C as we find.

01:05.850 --> 01:12.390
Now the first one is incorrect because that's calling the read to read underscores is the function.

01:12.390 --> 01:19.380
But the problem here is that it's just having a parameter here and we don't specifically say that we

01:19.380 --> 01:29.640
call the read underscores is the function from the Pender's import for Pandamonium then B is also Penner's

01:29.640 --> 01:30.310
that Penders.

01:30.330 --> 01:36.330
Well there would be a module called Penders which has another module in it called Pender's which then

01:36.390 --> 01:41.080
has this function called read on the Scorsese be so incorrect as well.

01:41.160 --> 01:43.620
C is completely incorrect.

01:43.620 --> 01:50.280
So the correct answer is the way you just use the module name and then the function that we would like

01:50.280 --> 01:51.010
to use.

01:51.120 --> 01:55.770
So we can go ahead and say the right solution is D.

01:55.950 --> 02:01.680
So now which command do you need to include the panel's module to use to read on the Scorsese V and

02:01.680 --> 02:09.430
read underscore ex-SO functions directly from the module like any function in standard python can call.

02:09.450 --> 02:15.570
So there are multiple different approaches here and only one of them is correct so the first one says

02:15.570 --> 02:21.090
from Pandurs import with underscores VI and then also the brackets.

02:21.090 --> 02:22.930
Same for the Exel.

02:22.950 --> 02:24.440
Then we have to be without it.

02:24.480 --> 02:26.460
And B is actually the correct answer.

02:26.460 --> 02:30.240
So in this case we will try to call this function.

02:30.240 --> 02:37.250
Same here in this case we actually import only those functions from that particular module.

02:37.470 --> 02:40.410
So this one here is not working at all.

02:40.560 --> 02:44.840
So C is completely incorrect and the same goes for D where we just say ok.

02:44.940 --> 02:50.650
Import Penasco routines we come to import panels to create an axle.

02:50.670 --> 02:54.730
So the correct one is B.

02:54.810 --> 03:02.370
Now let's have a look at the last task how can you include the more your Ponder's and renamed handle

03:02.370 --> 03:08.390
names so that you can use an abbreviation for example PD instead of the module.

03:08.580 --> 03:10.920
So import pand us and then PD.

03:11.070 --> 03:14.760
Well that would be a call of a function.

03:14.760 --> 03:18.480
So that's incorrect with this PD paramita or argument.

03:18.480 --> 03:19.370
In this case.

03:19.410 --> 03:21.150
So that's definitely incorrect.

03:21.150 --> 03:22.560
Then the next one.

03:22.950 --> 03:24.950
Well that is incorrect as well.

03:25.110 --> 03:31.260
So the correct answer is C where we are actually saying OK I want to import Pandurs and I would like

03:31.260 --> 03:38.070
to use it as PD So I want to whenever I need to call it I want to state something like Piddy my function

03:39.250 --> 03:40.190
something like that.

03:40.260 --> 03:42.480
So I could call it like this.

03:42.480 --> 03:46.330
So the correct answer is C..

03:46.920 --> 03:47.390
All right.

03:47.430 --> 03:54.150
So I hope you manage to get all the answers correctly in the next video we're going to check out.

03:54.150 --> 03:56.970
Another example for the modules so see you there.
