00:00.390 --> 00:01.150
We'll come back.

00:01.170 --> 00:07.800
Now it's time to check out signals and slots in huge creator and in the next video we're going to see

00:07.800 --> 00:09.720
how to do it in Python.

00:09.720 --> 00:15.230
So first of all I'm going to get rid of every thing in my central widget.

00:15.240 --> 00:18.570
So I'm just going to select all of them.

00:18.570 --> 00:19.820
Also the spacer.

00:19.860 --> 00:22.370
I'm going to delete all of them.

00:22.470 --> 00:30.000
So now I have an empty and clean UI and in here I'm just going to drag in a push button and a checkbox

00:30.060 --> 00:31.380
right next to it.

00:31.590 --> 00:38.220
So now what I want to do is that if somebody presses this push button that the checkbox is activated

00:38.550 --> 00:45.720
because the signal can come from the push button but the receiver can be the checkbox and I can pretty

00:45.720 --> 00:48.090
much model that very easily.

00:48.090 --> 00:49.480
And how do I do that.

00:49.740 --> 00:50.650
Well let's check it out.

00:50.670 --> 00:53.900
Go to signals and slots here at the bottom.

00:53.940 --> 00:59.500
So at the very bottom there is this tab next to action editor signals and slots.

00:59.700 --> 01:06.540
And here I'm going to press the plus button in order to create a new signal and slot entry.

01:06.750 --> 01:12.860
So in order to do that I can select a sender a signal a receiver and a slot.

01:13.150 --> 01:14.580
And let's check this out.

01:14.580 --> 01:15.480
One by one.

01:15.690 --> 01:22.950
So what I want to do is once somebody's precious There's push button I want to send out a signal and

01:22.950 --> 01:27.090
the signal should be happening when somebody clicks the push button.

01:27.090 --> 01:33.720
So when the clicked method is called then what should happen what should happen is that the checkbox

01:34.140 --> 01:41.160
is going to be the receiver and that should change its slot and we will see what that is so let's check

01:41.160 --> 01:41.440
it out.

01:41.460 --> 01:42.660
Let's go to the sender.

01:42.690 --> 01:46.980
And here I can say OK my push button.

01:46.980 --> 01:49.980
So this one here should be the sender.

01:49.980 --> 01:54.870
Why is it called Push button with a lower cap push or P.

01:55.020 --> 02:00.020
Well that's because if we look at this push button we can check out the object name and we can see that

02:00.030 --> 02:01.660
it's called Push button.

02:01.680 --> 02:06.930
So the name here is what's important and that's what also the sender name that you can find here.

02:06.930 --> 02:12.980
So if I would change to add to my button for example and then I go to sender.

02:13.050 --> 02:18.490
You see it automatically changed so the signals and slots and tree automatically changed to my button.

02:18.510 --> 02:21.510
So that's what this object name is all for.

02:21.780 --> 02:23.400
Then we have the signal.

02:23.400 --> 02:28.240
So what should be the signal that is send out all the signals should be clicked.

02:28.470 --> 02:33.330
So we can see the abstract button has multiple signals.

02:33.390 --> 02:38.060
The key widget has multiple signals and the object has multiple signals.

02:38.080 --> 02:40.190
So the one destroyed for example.

02:40.200 --> 02:42.040
So this object is destroyed.

02:42.210 --> 02:44.760
Then we could send out a signal for example.

02:44.760 --> 02:47.560
But the one that we want to use is click it.

02:47.580 --> 02:52.840
So if somebody clicked on that push button we want the receiver.

02:52.980 --> 03:01.090
And in this case it's going to be our checkbox to change something and it should be the slot toggle.

03:01.320 --> 03:06.990
So it should pretty much say from the abstract button to just toggle It's called the toggle method.

03:07.140 --> 03:13.330
And what that will do is it will pretty much make this checkbox active or inactive.

03:13.350 --> 03:14.900
So let's just check this out.

03:15.060 --> 03:16.110
Let's do that.

03:16.110 --> 03:25.200
And now let's save our main window right white and go back to our pie chart and in there we need to

03:25.200 --> 03:32.960
run our build again so that it takes all of the changes and now we can run the main and you'll see once

03:32.960 --> 03:38.930
we press this push button you can see the checkbox actually activated once again as you can see can

03:38.930 --> 03:45.590
activate and deactivate and that is done by the push button being the sender and the checkbox being

03:45.590 --> 03:52.610
the receiver so now can of course change the slot so before was toggle maybe we want to hide.

03:52.670 --> 03:56.870
So let's say I want to hide the element if somebody presses this push button.

03:56.900 --> 04:05.180
So let me save it again then let me execute my build and now let me execute my main again so that will

04:05.180 --> 04:05.830
open up.

04:05.870 --> 04:11.300
And as you can see once I press the push button it disappears it's just Heights and the problem is I

04:11.300 --> 04:16.120
cannot unhide it anymore because hiding and hiding is not the same thing here.

04:16.130 --> 04:22.850
So that would be for example something that we could do in Python code so you could say OK push button

04:22.850 --> 04:27.290
was pressed hide the checkbox push past and was pressed again.

04:27.290 --> 04:28.710
Unhide the checkbox.

04:28.940 --> 04:31.060
But as you can see it's very limited.

04:31.190 --> 04:35.080
How we can do that in the qued creator.

04:35.300 --> 04:40.250
So as you can see there is only this hide method and if we check out the other ones you can see there

04:40.250 --> 04:41.290
are plenty.

04:41.630 --> 04:52.010
There is also this show method that can be called as well said focus repaint raised lower pretty much

04:52.250 --> 04:58.400
several methods here and that's how you can create signals and slots.

04:58.970 --> 05:01.460
But we will see how to do that in Python in the next video.
