Come back I hope you manage to go for quiz for comments and easily answer the questions correctly and

00:06.340 --> 00:08.070
then you of course can skip this for you.

00:08.190 --> 00:10.860
Otherwise let's have a look at the questions.

00:10.890 --> 00:17.010
So first of all we have this question which characters do start a comment in Python which should not

00:17.010 --> 00:18.820
be executed as code.

00:19.110 --> 00:25.710
And if we check that out we can see a is a hash then B is double star.

00:25.710 --> 00:32.790
C is a percentage sign and D is a dollar sign and the correct answer here is a.

00:32.940 --> 00:34.210
So the mantra.

00:34.500 --> 00:41.460
So if you want to create a line of code which is common to doubt then you can simply use to hash sign

00:41.820 --> 00:43.800
or hash key.

00:43.800 --> 00:49.690
Now question number two which numbers are output when the following program executes.

00:49.710 --> 00:54.000
So print 1 print 2 but with a hash at the beginning.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.360
Print 3 and print four with a hash at the beginning.

00:57.630 --> 01:03.200
So what that does is print does it print out A B C or D.

01:03.400 --> 01:04.860
Well a is one two three four.

01:04.860 --> 01:06.780
So all of them would be print out.

01:06.960 --> 01:07.860
B is non.

01:07.860 --> 01:09.830
So none of the four would be printed out.

01:09.870 --> 01:11.270
C is 2 and 4.

01:11.280 --> 01:18.900
So this line and that line so two and four will be executed or D where only 1 and 3 would be printed

01:18.900 --> 01:20.100
onto the console.

01:20.250 --> 01:26.010
And you can of course test it any time if you really want to make sure you understood it.

01:26.010 --> 01:28.410
But here it's very basic.

01:28.410 --> 01:33.460
We are just saying OK this line of code is executed because there is no hash.

01:33.480 --> 01:38.700
This line of code is not going to be executed because there is a hash at the start of the line and this

01:38.700 --> 01:39.690
line neither.

01:39.690 --> 01:43.010
So print 1 and print 3 will be executed.

01:43.010 --> 01:46.380
So we only get 1 and 3 on to the console.

01:46.410 --> 01:49.380
And that's why D is the correct answer.
