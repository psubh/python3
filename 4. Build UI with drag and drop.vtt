00:00.570 --> 00:05.730
Come back in this video we are going to see an alternative to typing everything manually because that's

00:05.730 --> 00:10.090
exactly what we did last time when we created our you I manually.

00:10.230 --> 00:17.050
And it was quite some work we had to write a lot of code and if we run the application we can see that

00:17.100 --> 00:19.390
it's really just this little button.

00:19.410 --> 00:25.160
And then this window would with a checkbox so that's not very nice and it's a lot of work for just a

00:25.160 --> 00:28.070
little piece of UI elements.

00:28.260 --> 00:34.970
Well we're going to find a way to do it in a much much more sophisticated and better way.

00:34.980 --> 00:36.590
So in order to do so.

00:36.720 --> 00:38.860
Open up your cube creator.

00:39.060 --> 00:46.200
So you installed this tool within this chapter and it's called cute creator or puti Creator and there

00:46.260 --> 00:48.920
you can anytime create a new project.

00:48.930 --> 00:55.920
So we're going to create a new project and we select cute widgets application by the way you could have

00:55.920 --> 01:03.600
a lot more possible Leakey's here if you had installed more application or more aspects of qued in the

01:03.600 --> 01:04.620
installation process.

01:04.620 --> 01:11.300
But the one that we want to use is this huge widget application which supports the platform desktop.

01:11.400 --> 01:15.350
That's exactly what we want and we're going to choose that.

01:15.420 --> 01:19.940
Now we need to give it a name and this is going to be the project location.

01:19.950 --> 01:24.990
So we're going to put all of its files and I'm going to call this UI.

01:25.160 --> 01:31.590
But now what's important is that I go into the same folder where I had my application here so I had

01:31.590 --> 01:36.890
it under this directory here in my den is pulling it up chump projects to the manager.

01:37.080 --> 01:44.180
So I'm going to copy the path and we'll use it in my cute here.

01:44.280 --> 01:50.610
So the students manager browse real quick just to see where I'm in the.

01:50.660 --> 01:51.410
Yes I am.

01:51.420 --> 01:55.530
Do the managers select the folder and then I press next.

01:55.840 --> 01:57.330
And here just click next.

01:57.340 --> 02:00.950
Again so many options just like that one.

02:01.080 --> 02:05.550
I'm going to leave the names as well last names header files and so forth.

02:05.870 --> 02:15.500
Everything is standard and then we just press finish gate a bunch of files for us but the C++ code is

02:15.500 --> 02:17.240
not really what we were interested in.

02:17.240 --> 02:24.800
What we are interested in is in so there is a folder called forms here and it contains this main window.

02:24.930 --> 02:29.320
So I would just double click it and here you can create your UI.

02:29.360 --> 02:37.100
So for example you can make your window a little bigger then you can drag in a push button you can add

02:37.550 --> 02:44.450
some radio buttons that say I want to have multiple radio buttons here and those that we are they are

02:44.450 --> 02:45.810
not perfectly aligned yet.

02:45.830 --> 02:51.520
But that doesn't matter for now because it's just about the general idea of this.

02:51.770 --> 02:55.270
Then you can pretty much create a bunch of stuff here.

02:55.270 --> 03:00.380
So from all it everything that you see here you can just drag it in and then just test what it does

03:00.410 --> 03:03.030
and you will see which different options you have.

03:03.030 --> 03:05.680
So I'm just going to get a check box here as well.

03:05.690 --> 03:10.880
Now if let's say I want to change the name of the pushbutton or missed the text that it says then I

03:10.880 --> 03:24.170
can just call this Click Me and the radio button would be something like Choice 1 then Choice 2 and

03:24.190 --> 03:26.260
made the choice 3.

03:26.720 --> 03:32.040
Even though we haven't connected them to each other yet then we have this check box.

03:32.090 --> 03:34.120
I like this.

03:34.190 --> 03:37.880
So either you like it or not and you can check it and so forth.

03:37.880 --> 03:40.550
So there are plenty of different UI elements that you can.

03:40.580 --> 03:43.140
Greg in here very easily and.

03:43.160 --> 03:43.570
Yeah.

03:43.580 --> 03:48.730
So I'm going to save it as you can see there's a little star which indicates that it's not saved going

03:48.730 --> 03:50.470
to save it with control.

03:50.960 --> 03:53.540
And now my file will be safe.

03:53.540 --> 04:01.130
Now if I check this same file in my PI charm and as you can see if you go back to pide term suddenly

04:01.130 --> 04:06.650
there's UI folders in here you will find there is this main window that the white folder.

04:06.650 --> 04:15.170
Now let me double click it and if it doesn't open up double clicking you know opens up a main window

04:15.360 --> 04:22.180
wide open then you can just drag it in here so it will create a new window here when you tap.

04:22.550 --> 04:29.370
And now you can see that you get x m l text here which is just structured code.

04:29.390 --> 04:34.510
You could say it's very similar to M L where you have an opening tag and a closing tag.

04:34.700 --> 04:41.890
And this pretty much structures our whole file that we've just created here or our whole UI.

04:41.900 --> 04:50.510
So this UI that we've created is now created in SML code where it pretty much says OK there is a queue

04:50.510 --> 04:53.390
widget which is called queue push button.

04:53.420 --> 05:00.440
It has the property or there's a property called Geometry which says it's forgie whatever x values 40

05:00.930 --> 05:01.840
y values.

05:01.870 --> 05:05.450
And with this 80 the height is 22 and so forth.

05:05.570 --> 05:11.570
So all of the different UI elements that we have created like the radio button and another radio button

05:12.010 --> 05:18.890
and the third rate you button they are all in here and they all have specific values for for example

05:18.890 --> 05:23.900
their geometry and they have a specific text like Choice 3 and so forth.

05:23.900 --> 05:29.720
So there are properties in there already they can have more properties but we just have the standard

05:29.720 --> 05:35.900
one so we've created or that were created for us based on that were based on what we've done pretty

05:35.900 --> 05:38.360
much in the huge creator.

05:38.360 --> 05:41.050
So now what shall we do with this.

05:41.050 --> 05:47.360
Because we don't care about X-amount we don't want to work with X-amount at least that's what I don't

05:47.360 --> 05:48.440
want to do in this video.

05:48.440 --> 05:50.790
I want to focus on Python code right.

05:50.960 --> 05:57.150
So how do I go ahead and create Python code from it's because I don't want this to be SML I want it

05:57.150 --> 05:58.080
to be Python.

05:58.250 --> 05:59.670
Well there is a way to do it.

05:59.720 --> 06:05.630
And we need to create a new file which will pretty much convert that Exham elde code into Python code

06:05.630 --> 06:06.920
for us.

06:06.920 --> 06:09.460
So let's create a python file which takes care of it.

06:09.470 --> 06:17.280
So I created in the student manager directory creating a python file which I call build's thought why.

06:17.750 --> 06:27.170
And in here I'm just going to say from q t pie or Q Why I want to import do you.

06:27.190 --> 06:32.010
I see you could remember and like you I converted.

06:32.290 --> 06:43.290
And what it should do is it should compile my UI based on directories so the directory should be UI.

06:43.400 --> 06:47.900
So what it's going to do is it pretty much is going to check out this whole UI folder and that's why

06:47.900 --> 06:53.000
it's important that we have this build up here why in this to the manager and the why Holder is to the

06:53.000 --> 06:54.160
manager as well.

06:54.200 --> 07:00.170
So it's just going to pretty much create a python file based on the files in here and mainly based on

07:00.170 --> 07:01.140
this main window.

07:01.130 --> 07:01.980
Q Why.

07:02.230 --> 07:11.010
So if I now save this file this build the wine and I executed by running it you will see that here we

07:11.010 --> 07:13.010
have a new file called main window.

07:13.010 --> 07:13.610
What.

07:13.920 --> 07:20.030
So let me open that main window peel by file and you can see it's automatically created for us form

07:20.040 --> 07:27.800
implementation generated from reading you why file main window you are created by P Why Q T 5 y code

07:27.800 --> 07:30.100
generator 5 9 2 warning.

07:30.120 --> 07:32.720
All changes made in this file will last.

07:33.000 --> 07:38.880
OK so we cannot change this file pretty much as it says here and we would have to change it in the main

07:38.880 --> 07:39.340
UI.

07:39.390 --> 07:46.660
We're in our tudy creator but as you can see you get Typhon Koshare So it says from the cute 5 important

07:46.710 --> 07:53.850
core cute GUI on and cute widgets and we have this class called you our main window which takes in an

07:53.850 --> 07:59.970
object and there is this method called set up UI which needs a main window so it needs cell and main

07:59.970 --> 08:00.410
windows.

08:00.420 --> 08:07.440
So what we can now do with this is pretty much create this UI that we have just created disgress user

08:07.440 --> 08:15.740
interface here in Python by just changing our main wife files and Cosin here we had our window.

08:15.750 --> 08:19.740
Then we had the button with the checkbox and that was pretty much it.

08:19.740 --> 08:25.110
So I'm going to get rid of all of this code from button to check box and when to delete that and in

08:25.110 --> 08:32.910
here I'm just going to create a main window for you main window object.

08:32.910 --> 08:34.100
So how do I do that.

08:34.230 --> 08:37.400
Well first of all I need to import this main window.

08:37.440 --> 08:38.940
Why and how do I do that.

08:38.940 --> 08:48.570
Well I just say from you I dot main window so there is a main window file and didn't do it automatically

08:48.570 --> 08:49.220
correctly.

08:49.230 --> 08:54.250
So from you I got main window which pretty much means from this UI.

08:54.420 --> 08:59.700
Then there is a main window python file and in there you have a class called you main window.

08:59.820 --> 09:10.070
So please import you by main window so now we are importing this class here which contains the two methods

09:10.160 --> 09:14.360
which contains this CWI method and to translate your.

09:14.750 --> 09:19.370
And this set up method as you can see contains a central widget.

09:19.370 --> 09:24.000
It contains a push button which is a push button which we have seen in the past.

09:24.020 --> 09:28.610
Then it sets the geometry to a specific position on the form.

09:28.610 --> 09:35.180
So pretty much on the UI then we have another radio button radio button to read your button three and

09:35.180 --> 09:37.090
they all have specific positions.

09:37.130 --> 09:40.400
Same for check boxes and so forth and so forth.

09:40.400 --> 09:46.250
So we have some things like a menu bar and a main two bar status bar which were automatically created

09:46.250 --> 09:48.480
for us which we haven't dragged in there.

09:48.830 --> 09:55.160
OK so now how do I actually sign this main window that we have here.

09:55.160 --> 09:58.270
We have a window we already just says student manager.

09:58.270 --> 09:59.020
We still have it.

09:59.060 --> 10:05.210
So if I run the main but why we still get this empty window we can see how do I fill it up with the

10:05.210 --> 10:11.660
window that we have created here because we have created a very beautiful UI here already and now it's

10:11.660 --> 10:13.720
time to put it in here now.

10:13.730 --> 10:20.210
Well how do we do that is we create an object or a window class.

10:20.390 --> 10:26.260
So we pretty much create an instance of this UI main window class here and I'm going to call it UI window

10:26.620 --> 10:31.690
and I'm just saying OK this is going to be our UI main window.

10:32.300 --> 10:40.320
And now I can set up the UI so I can call this set of UI methods that we have here.

10:40.520 --> 10:45.690
This one which is going to set up a UI but it needs a main window where it should be displayed.

10:45.710 --> 10:52.730
So here I just say OK the window that we have created before which wasn't the main window so our window

10:52.970 --> 10:59.720
widgets main window is going to be the one that I passed to you and now we can go ahead and execute

10:59.720 --> 11:00.590
our code again.

11:00.590 --> 11:03.830
So let me run it again run again.

11:03.830 --> 11:06.000
And as you can see now I have my UI.

11:06.200 --> 11:07.580
So this Click Me button.

11:07.610 --> 11:09.180
I have my check box.

11:09.290 --> 11:14.540
My choice boxes or my Combo Boxes here with my three choices.

11:14.570 --> 11:15.320
All right.

11:15.410 --> 11:17.930
So that's already pretty much how we can do that.

11:17.930 --> 11:18.170
Right.

11:18.170 --> 11:26.450
So we can just drag and drop stuff in there and then we can go ahead and pretty much make Python code

11:26.450 --> 11:33.180
from it and then use it in our Python of course there's a lot more to learn about this and we haven't

11:33.180 --> 11:37.250
seen how to use user input and stuff like that.

11:37.260 --> 11:43.330
So we are going to check out the cute creator and a lot more detail and depth in the next video.

11:43.380 --> 11:46.680
And then later we're going to see how we can actually use user input.

11:46.710 --> 11:48.210
So see you in the next video.
