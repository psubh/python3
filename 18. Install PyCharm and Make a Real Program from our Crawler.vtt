00:00.070 --> 00:07.140
We'll come back in this video we are going to install pite charm and PI charm is an IEEE which stands

00:07.140 --> 00:14.070
for Integrated Development Environment and it allows us to develop with Python in a slightly different

00:14.070 --> 00:15.860
way than Jupiter notebooks to us.

00:15.990 --> 00:20.070
So so far we have used chip in our notebooks because it's very awesome.

00:20.070 --> 00:26.880
In order to learn Python and display stuff straight away and also have all of these very beautiful text

00:28.380 --> 00:33.590
messages just below and above a code bracket or code piece.

00:33.690 --> 00:39.990
And now we're going to go ahead and use pi charms so you can just check out more Google PI and download

00:40.020 --> 00:44.040
or just get used to the link that I provide in this lecture.

00:44.160 --> 00:47.760
So what you need to do is you need to download the community version.

00:47.760 --> 00:55.890
Of course you could use a professional version if you want to go ahead and really use D-y charm professionally

00:55.920 --> 00:59.900
but it will cost you something so you need to apply for it and stuff like that.

01:00.030 --> 01:04.860
So the one that we're going to use is the community one so just press download and download the file.

01:04.980 --> 01:12.180
And as you can see now getting this DNG file this disk image and once that download is done I'm going

01:12.180 --> 01:19.440
to start the installation by the way you can also give them some information about you and while you

01:19.440 --> 01:23.340
can get some information via e-mail by Giedd brains.

01:23.580 --> 01:29.340
So they're pretty pro and they can give you some advice maybe or at least they can send you some information

01:29.400 --> 01:31.020
which could be interesting to you.

01:31.020 --> 01:35.880
All right so I'm just going to agree with Jed brains to using cookies.

01:35.910 --> 01:39.100
And once that is done here I'm going to start.

01:39.240 --> 01:39.650
All right.

01:39.660 --> 01:44.370
So now it's done and in my case I'm going to download DDM or install the DMG file.

01:44.370 --> 01:51.030
If you are the windows of course you must have downloaded the X file and install that right and there

01:51.030 --> 01:51.450
we are.

01:51.450 --> 01:59.800
So now I have the white charm here I go to select it and it will start the installation process.

01:59.820 --> 02:03.090
Now it says it's downloaded from the internet and I'm going to.

02:03.360 --> 02:04.930
Well trust Brandt's.

02:04.980 --> 02:08.920
So I'm going to press a pen now.

02:08.940 --> 02:12.260
Ask me whether I would like to import something.

02:12.300 --> 02:17.310
So if you have any configuration files from another installation that you ever used then you can of

02:17.310 --> 02:22.080
course use that or you can just say computer do not import settings.

02:22.350 --> 02:25.190
Then we need to read through the license agreement.

02:25.200 --> 02:32.460
And once you're done with that you can accept it and you can decide whether you want to share data or

02:32.460 --> 02:32.880
not.

02:32.880 --> 02:35.420
I'm a German are going to share data at all.

02:35.490 --> 02:40.740
Of course you would help those guys out so if something goes wrong and they will be able to help you

02:40.740 --> 02:48.000
out so you can use to keep them scheme in my case I can choose between the one for Mac OS or the one

02:48.270 --> 02:52.500
that is default for all platforms and I'm just going to use that one.

02:52.500 --> 02:59.050
So if I use other versions like the Windows version then stuff will be a little different.

02:59.070 --> 03:01.140
So then I can choose the UI theme.

03:01.170 --> 03:03.030
So the light one and dark one.

03:03.030 --> 03:08.500
So you can choose whether you want to have the bright and light one or the Dark One.

03:08.520 --> 03:11.150
So I have seen multiple preferences.

03:11.160 --> 03:13.290
Some of my students prefer dark.

03:13.290 --> 03:18.930
Others prefer the light version and I've heard that some people have problems with a dark version so

03:18.990 --> 03:20.340
we're viewing that version.

03:20.340 --> 03:22.950
I'm just going to use the light version here.

03:22.990 --> 03:24.380
All right so the next.

03:24.510 --> 03:28.490
And here you can you create a launcher script.

03:29.010 --> 03:32.080
And I'm just going to say next feature plug ins.

03:32.280 --> 03:40.380
And here you can add other languages support and there as you can see idea of them Mark downburst support

03:40.380 --> 03:41.600
and Arling support.

03:41.670 --> 03:46.440
And we're going to need neither of them so we're just going to say start using pi charm and that will

03:46.440 --> 03:52.440
then finally open up part charme where we see this welcome screen where we can go ahead and create a

03:52.440 --> 03:57.470
new project and that's what I'm going to say create new project.

03:57.810 --> 04:02.360
And here I can decide where I would like to store the files.

04:02.490 --> 04:07.300
So under in my case then is Python projects and untied.

04:07.410 --> 04:16.240
So this will be the name of my file and I'm going to call that Petrum crawler PI charm crawler.

04:16.440 --> 04:23.430
And here I want to click on this project interpretor or you should click on it and you can choose which

04:23.430 --> 04:28.340
environment you want to use or which pretty much which interpreter you want to use.

04:28.560 --> 04:32.710
And you could of course go ahead and use the new environment use using.

04:32.720 --> 04:39.480
So you could use to the virtual environment or you use an existing interpreter and there you need to

04:39.480 --> 04:44.450
choose an icon the end here and can choose Konda environment.

04:44.760 --> 04:50.430
And there I need to select Anaconda so I need to find a folder where I had Anaconda installed.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.640
And here I select users.

04:53.640 --> 04:56.480
Then my username and an account or three.

04:56.550 --> 05:06.550
So that's where the condos installed then been you will find the and folder or the python file that

05:06.550 --> 05:07.480
we want to use.

05:07.510 --> 05:12.630
So just scroll down to the point where you have a hyphen.

05:12.880 --> 05:16.590
So just select the python app here and then press OK.

05:17.010 --> 05:19.930
And now we can press ok again.

05:19.940 --> 05:24.110
And as you can see the interpreter will now be Python 3.6.

05:24.130 --> 05:29.280
So our Anaconda 3 then python app and now compressed create.

05:29.410 --> 05:35.130
So that will do is it will create my new project and here I'll have plenty of tips of the day.

05:35.230 --> 05:41.020
You can of course show them and they will constantly give you good tips on how to use a tool or you

05:41.020 --> 05:42.810
can deactivate them.

05:42.970 --> 05:43.230
All right.

05:43.240 --> 05:48.440
And then it will take a little while because it's going to scan the installed packages and I'm going

05:48.440 --> 05:52.840
to say don't give me any tips and close it and then just wait until it's done.

05:52.840 --> 05:57.550
So as you can see there's a little bar here and it is indexing currently.

05:57.670 --> 06:01.060
And once that is done you can go ahead and use pie charm.

06:01.120 --> 06:01.500
All right.

06:01.510 --> 06:07.740
Now that my installation is done and the preparation is done we have the whole project now.

06:07.750 --> 06:10.960
So you can see this is my project here charme crawler.

06:11.050 --> 06:16.640
And currently there are no files in there and that's what we are going to check out in the next video.

06:16.750 --> 06:18.170
So see you there.
