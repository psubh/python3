00:00.360 --> 00:01.050
All right.

00:01.050 --> 00:08.340
So let's check out the simple solution for the challenge and it was to display the name last name and

00:08.820 --> 00:13.590
then also the subject where the major of the student.

00:13.770 --> 00:17.760
And then we needed to button so we can put them at the top we can put them at the bottom it doesn't

00:17.760 --> 00:18.700
really matter.

00:18.770 --> 00:25.830
But what we will do is first of all I'm going to get rid of all the elements and I will put them in

00:25.830 --> 00:31.170
one by one again so I'm going to add a table widget and I'm going to add two buttons.

00:31.170 --> 00:36.410
So first I have this push button and then I have another push button next to it.

00:36.600 --> 00:42.920
So as you can see now suddenly I have this weird behavior and if I drag it out you can see very easy

00:42.930 --> 00:43.860
Deemer push buttons.

00:43.860 --> 00:45.960
They adjust automatically.

00:46.020 --> 00:48.500
So that's the beauty of cute creator.

00:48.510 --> 00:50.830
It does that for us automatically.

00:50.850 --> 00:53.870
Now of course the text of those buttons should be changed.

00:53.910 --> 00:59.970
So this one will be something like new entry or save button so it depends on what you prefer.

00:59.970 --> 01:05.310
I would rather say that the left one should be a new entry and the right one should be safe because

01:05.310 --> 01:11.150
that's normally what you would expect in the exercice where I gave it to you.

01:11.310 --> 01:13.200
I said that the other way around.

01:13.230 --> 01:15.040
So it's really not that important.

01:15.060 --> 01:17.900
In which way you do it at least for this exercise.

01:18.030 --> 01:25.440
But when you look at user interfaces of other software you usually have the save button more towards

01:25.440 --> 01:26.700
the right hand side.

01:26.790 --> 01:33.570
So we are just going to say new entry on the left hand side of the left button and there's going to

01:33.570 --> 01:36.210
be safe.

01:36.270 --> 01:39.120
OK now we of course can give them proper names as well.

01:39.120 --> 01:45.420
So the push button to which is the save button should be called Save button and this new entry button

01:45.420 --> 01:45.870
I'll give it.

01:45.870 --> 01:53.190
Also a different name where I'm going to say new entry button so it's more descriptive and it is more

01:53.520 --> 01:56.360
precise on what it actually does.

01:56.400 --> 02:00.180
Then we have this table widget and I'm going to rename it.

02:00.180 --> 02:03.830
I'm going to use college students table.

02:03.840 --> 02:10.380
Now we also want to add some more entries in here for example more columns so we need one column which

02:10.380 --> 02:13.150
will be the first name.

02:13.440 --> 02:24.270
Then another column which would be the last name and a third column which will be the subject line right

02:24.450 --> 02:25.650
now in terms of rows.

02:25.650 --> 02:33.660
I'm just going to add some rows and rows you row and row one just so we have some rows for the basic

02:33.780 --> 02:37.510
entries and this one will be John Doe.

02:37.590 --> 02:41.220
And he's in for medic's major.

02:41.400 --> 02:49.260
Then we have let's say Erica Fisher and she's a mathematics student.

02:49.620 --> 02:53.700
OK you see that they are called new call them you call them you call them that will change as soon as

02:53.700 --> 02:54.660
we press.

02:54.690 --> 02:56.490
OK here we are.

02:56.580 --> 03:00.220
And now what I don't like is that this last one here.

03:00.240 --> 03:08.890
This last column is not going towards the end of the view or of our window.

03:09.060 --> 03:11.050
So how do we fix that.

03:11.580 --> 03:13.590
Well there was something called

03:16.430 --> 03:21.560
horizontal Hetter stretch last section so I'm going to be dead.

03:21.560 --> 03:26.340
And as you can see now my subject is moving along.

03:26.370 --> 03:33.860
Now of course based on the width of your project that you have it could make sense to change also the

03:33.860 --> 03:35.060
hether with.

03:35.060 --> 03:40.470
So this one here had a default section size we could change to to let's say 100.

03:40.700 --> 03:44.390
And that's not as much space maybe for long names.

03:44.390 --> 03:45.660
It's not a good idea.

03:45.710 --> 03:47.710
Maybe 120 is a little better.

03:47.870 --> 03:50.990
So you can just play around with the values and see what works for you.

03:50.990 --> 03:56.230
So if somebody has a super long name or a double name then maybe one fifth is actually better.

03:56.390 --> 04:01.660
But then we should make the whole screen a little wider and stuff like that.

04:01.660 --> 04:03.630
All right so that's it for now.

04:03.770 --> 04:07.470
In the next video we are going to check out the next step.

04:07.490 --> 04:08.940
So see you there.
