This lesson you will learn how to go through a dictionary entry by entry and why you need to unpack

00:05.820 --> 00:07.300
tuples for it.

00:07.320 --> 00:07.580
All right.

00:07.590 --> 00:16.140
So if you want to go through every single item within your dictionary and by item I mean a pair.

00:16.140 --> 00:23.700
So this is a paper which is an item unique and you see as example you can go ahead and of course say

00:23.700 --> 00:25.610
four key in D.

00:25.770 --> 00:27.300
Print the key.

00:27.360 --> 00:32.980
So this way we get the key and it can seem unique Budapest and Helsinki.

00:33.180 --> 00:40.430
But then if you want to have the value well you can simply say value is equal to D.

00:40.860 --> 00:42.760
And here is key.

00:42.780 --> 00:43.650
So the.

00:43.770 --> 00:51.000
And the entry for the key so goes through every single entry and creates the key and then it just uses

00:51.000 --> 00:53.040
the key in order to find out the value.

00:53.340 --> 00:57.530
And then we can of course go ahead and print the value as well.

00:57.530 --> 01:02.430
So let's do that as it can seem unique and you see Europe has the and so forth.

01:03.030 --> 01:05.140
That is a totally valid approach.

01:05.250 --> 01:12.840
But then you can do something pretty cool because you can use them as tuples So this can be a tool that

01:12.840 --> 01:13.830
can be a tuple.

01:13.830 --> 01:16.830
So every single item can be used as a tuple.

01:16.860 --> 01:26.390
So if we do is following four key comma value in the dot items and by dealer items Let's check it out.

01:26.430 --> 01:38.430
Print the dot items and I'm really missing a closing bracket as you can see dict items so you can get

01:38.430 --> 01:40.470
all the dictionary items in there.

01:40.590 --> 01:47.040
And as you can see it's actually stored as a tuple so Munich and you see is stored as a tuple.

01:47.040 --> 01:47.830
How do I know that.

01:47.850 --> 01:55.620
Well you see that it's come in those brackets and it's separated by a comma and then that is generally

01:55.620 --> 01:59.160
how we create tuples or how tuples are represented right.

01:59.160 --> 02:05.090
So for key value in deduct items and dealer items is a set of tuples.

02:05.220 --> 02:09.570
So it goes through all the tuples and stores the key and value accordingly.

02:09.570 --> 02:11.550
And now we can just go ahead and print that.

02:11.550 --> 02:23.760
So print key plus the colon and the space plus value.

02:23.790 --> 02:27.660
So now we have this beautiful way of presenting the data accordingly.

02:27.720 --> 02:31.770
And with superdense as you can see just really those two lines of code.

02:32.070 --> 02:37.440
And that's pretty much what we're using here so this is the unpacking of tuples.

02:37.500 --> 02:42.760
And we're just using this for loop to go through all the tuples which are within the dictionary.

02:42.990 --> 02:47.130
So every single item in the dictionary is a tuple.

02:47.220 --> 02:50.990
So that's really what you should take away from this video.

02:51.210 --> 02:53.480
And the next video you'll see a little challenge.

02:53.520 --> 02:54.720
So see you there.
