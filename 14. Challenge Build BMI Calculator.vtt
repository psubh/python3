00:00.440 --> 00:01.880
We'll come back in this video.

00:01.890 --> 00:05.150
I would like to give you some hints for the exercise.

00:05.160 --> 00:11.380
So the first one is that if you want to set a text it has to be of type string.

00:11.640 --> 00:13.200
And why is that a problem.

00:13.200 --> 00:14.750
I will show you in a second.

00:14.760 --> 00:19.550
So let's say you take the value from the height or the weight.

00:19.740 --> 00:25.700
And if you take those values you get a decimal number or and sometimes you get an integer.

00:25.710 --> 00:29.310
But in some cases you get a decent number or a floating point number.

00:29.430 --> 00:32.160
Then if you let's say have this number.

00:32.400 --> 00:35.780
I'm just going to use something like this here.

00:36.240 --> 00:39.630
And you said that D as the value.

00:39.630 --> 00:41.250
So let's say you said D.

00:41.460 --> 00:43.020
Then you get an error.

00:43.330 --> 00:47.060
That is because the argument has unexpected type float.

00:47.100 --> 00:51.250
So this is a float this D but it's expecting a string.

00:51.390 --> 00:56.310
So what you need to do here is to actually cast it into a string.

00:56.310 --> 01:01.510
So if I run that suddenly it's going to work so I can see the BMI is set.

01:01.710 --> 01:06.700
OK so that's number one that I wanted to tell you.

01:06.720 --> 01:10.740
So this is just a little hint for my calculator if you feel like you don't need any hints you can of

01:10.740 --> 01:13.000
course try the exercise already.

01:13.080 --> 01:17.880
Then another one that I would like to show you is how you can hide an element.

01:17.880 --> 01:23.190
So in case you want to hide an element and there are actual cases where it really makes sense so let

01:23.190 --> 01:30.420
me run the code real quick and actually let me run the code once again with a text because otherwise

01:30.420 --> 01:31.370
I get this error.

01:31.560 --> 01:38.660
So this one two three here or in general this whole resoled UI element should be hidden.

01:38.730 --> 01:40.330
How do I hide elements.

01:40.590 --> 01:46.960
Well you can hide elements that say I will hide my button.

01:47.040 --> 01:54.250
So it's called calculate and I'm just going to say hide.

01:54.260 --> 01:59.240
So let me run it and you will see that the Calculate button is hidden.

01:59.240 --> 02:05.800
Now if you want to show it again you can call this show method and it will show the button again.

02:05.990 --> 02:07.970
So that's how you can hide something.

02:08.150 --> 02:13.280
And of course you don't want to hide the button but you want to hide the actual text.

02:13.280 --> 02:22.600
For example the result text and another info is that if we go back to our example from before this the

02:22.610 --> 02:27.010
1 to 3 which we had to cast to a string.

02:27.010 --> 02:34.220
And that's because said text is expecting a string and it doesn't expect a floating point value or a

02:34.220 --> 02:41.320
float in general so it's a typed part of permuted that you have here and you need a argument which is

02:41.420 --> 02:43.100
exactly the same type.

02:43.100 --> 02:47.450
Now the value that we get here has plenty of decimal points and I don't like that.

02:47.450 --> 02:55.130
So what really would make sense is to show the BMI maybe up to 2 points or two floating points or decimal

02:55.130 --> 02:55.880
points.

02:55.880 --> 02:56.850
So how do we do that.

02:56.870 --> 03:07.140
Well we can simply round the value so we could say round D and that well round D.

03:07.310 --> 03:13.070
But if you want to Rongji to two decimal points we can just enter two here.

03:13.220 --> 03:20.240
So let me run it again and you can see now it's just displaying 1 2 3 2 3 instead of 1 2 3 2 3 4 0 and

03:20.240 --> 03:21.260
so forth.

03:21.620 --> 03:23.380
OK that's another little hint.

03:23.390 --> 03:27.950
In order to make your program look good.

03:28.670 --> 03:33.410
And the last one is the formula for the BMI.

03:33.620 --> 03:40.610
We had that already but I'm just going to give you the BMI formula again which is body

03:43.430 --> 03:54.430
weight in kilograms divided by size or height.

03:54.470 --> 04:00.250
It's pretty much height and meters square.

04:00.990 --> 04:02.570
OK so that's the formula.

04:02.780 --> 04:05.390
And you may not divide by zero.

04:05.390 --> 04:07.120
So that's my last hint.

04:07.370 --> 04:10.130
So you could get a value that is zero.

04:10.130 --> 04:17.380
So if somebody decides to enter zero here as it's weight or he didn't enter anything in there where

04:17.390 --> 04:23.210
actually it's the height that should be the problem so if you divide by zero in the height and you press

04:23.210 --> 04:24.830
calculate then you will get it correct.

04:24.830 --> 04:27.370
So you need to find a way to fix that.

04:27.430 --> 04:28.160
OK.

04:28.550 --> 04:29.110
Good.

04:29.120 --> 04:34.780
So now you know everything that you need to know in order to build this application now.

04:34.790 --> 04:37.160
Good luck with it and enjoy the ride.

04:37.160 --> 04:42.260
So see you in the next video where I hope you will have finished this application.
