All right you will come back and this way I would like to give you a little hint on how you can read

00:05.010 --> 00:07.940
data from your cells.

00:08.100 --> 00:13.440
So let's go to our main a Y and here we had on push button click.

00:13.440 --> 00:15.300
For now what we did in there.

00:15.480 --> 00:23.670
Well we pretty much populate the data and I'm going to come those lines out because I would like to

00:24.150 --> 00:30.570
show you how you can actually read the data from a table and especially especially from a cell.

00:30.570 --> 00:38.280
So I'm going to create a new cell variable which will check out the table widget and there is something

00:38.280 --> 00:46.980
called item so we can very easily just get the item at a particular row and column and that's so if

00:47.220 --> 00:53.820
we print that and just do that real quick stop our application and run it again and push the button

00:55.050 --> 01:00.920
which the action button and you can see I get this table which had item object at so and so.

01:01.020 --> 01:08.790
So what this gives me is of course give me the whole cell object but the cell object contains properties

01:08.820 --> 01:10.240
and functions as well.

01:10.260 --> 01:12.200
So were methods as well.

01:12.330 --> 01:15.510
And the one that we want to have is the text.

01:16.110 --> 01:21.570
So you can see there is a method called text and that will return the text of that particular cell.

01:21.570 --> 01:23.580
So this is how we get the cell.

01:23.700 --> 01:26.270
And this is how we get the text of the cell.

01:26.280 --> 01:32.460
So here we are pretty much saying OK give me the item at a particular position in your table widget

01:32.820 --> 01:34.270
and stored in a cell.

01:34.380 --> 01:37.990
And here we say OK give me the text of the cell and print it.

01:38.010 --> 01:45.060
Now let me run it again and you will see that suddenly we get Munich because the cell that we're currently

01:45.060 --> 01:46.830
looking at is zero zero.

01:46.920 --> 01:53.340
Now if we would look at 1 0 then we will get

01:56.400 --> 01:57.150
Berlant.

01:57.230 --> 02:04.760
You can see the next line Berlin because row and column row 1 column 0 city.

02:04.800 --> 02:07.140
So it's pretty much means we will get Berlin.

02:07.320 --> 02:14.500
And now you can of course read through all of the data and you need to do that in a particular way.

02:14.520 --> 02:17.200
So you will need to find out how to do that.

02:17.220 --> 02:22.020
I'm not going to show you this because this is a big part of the challenge pretty much.

02:22.020 --> 02:25.760
So you could of course use loops you could use.

02:26.200 --> 02:29.380
Yeah you could also check out the documentation if there is a better way.

02:29.580 --> 02:31.550
And I wish you good luck with this.

02:31.590 --> 02:40.560
If you get stuck then just leave it for today or leave it for an hour or so then try it again or just

02:40.650 --> 02:46.170
try to debug it yourself because this is really the point where you should be able to find solutions

02:46.170 --> 02:50.240
on your own without having to require additional help.

02:50.310 --> 02:56.850
So you should really be able to just check out the documentation check out Stack Overflow debug your

02:56.850 --> 02:59.420
application and then you should be fine.

02:59.610 --> 03:06.930
So good luck with this exercise and I hope to see you in the next video where we will go through the

03:07.170 --> 03:08.350
final solution.

03:08.360 --> 03:12.150
Were these a sample solution of course there are multiple possible solutions.
