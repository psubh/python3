00:00.080 --> 00:05.730
Not you know if statements and comparison operators it's important to look at booleans a little closer

00:06.000 --> 00:12.720
because there is one important thing about balance and also AND and OR logic which we will cover in

00:12.720 --> 00:13.390
this video.

00:13.560 --> 00:16.270
So let's go ahead and create a variable called H.

00:16.290 --> 00:27.750
And let's just set that 35 and then if we check here age greater than equal 30 or greater or equal than

00:27.750 --> 00:33.420
30 and H lower equal 39.

00:33.720 --> 00:39.510
So we have this statement which contains of two checks or two comparisons.

00:39.540 --> 00:42.010
So we have one condition.

00:42.120 --> 00:45.810
The age has to be greater than or equal 30.

00:46.200 --> 00:53.120
And at the same time it has to be less than or equal 39.

00:53.130 --> 00:59.280
So only if that is the case we want to present something onto the console which is going to be this

00:59.370 --> 01:05.010
person is in its 30s something like that.

01:05.040 --> 01:07.460
So let's print that or let's execute that.

01:07.480 --> 01:13.770
And you can see this person is in its 30s it's printed on the console and that is because the person

01:13.770 --> 01:16.760
is 35 for the age of the person is 35.

01:17.010 --> 01:19.670
And that's why this condition is true.

01:19.710 --> 01:26.130
So 35 is greater than equal 30 and it is lower than equal 39.

01:26.160 --> 01:30.720
So if we enter something like 40 in here as you can see it's not executed.

01:31.040 --> 01:31.560
All right.

01:31.590 --> 01:40.110
So you said that back to 35 and it's executed again or it is executed anyways but this code is not executed

01:40.470 --> 01:42.730
if the condition here is not met.

01:42.730 --> 01:44.810
Or those two conditions are not met.

01:44.940 --> 01:45.550
And that's this.

01:45.610 --> 01:54.270
And what so and means both have to be true or not just both but all conditions if they are connected

01:54.270 --> 01:56.160
with an end each time.

01:56.160 --> 02:01.030
All right so now let's check out or what's that change to 45.

02:01.590 --> 02:13.560
And then if H is lower than 30 or less than 30 or the age is greater equal 40 only then we want to print

02:13.680 --> 02:27.720
something onto the console saying this person is not in its 30s and I think here that's correct.

02:27.720 --> 02:28.600
Now let's run again.

02:28.650 --> 02:31.840
This person is not in its thirties is printed.

02:31.860 --> 02:34.090
Because now it's 45.

02:34.200 --> 02:41.350
So we have this other thing where we use or which means either or has to be true.

02:41.460 --> 02:44.110
Only then this statement will be executed.

02:44.280 --> 02:47.830
So which means that it doesn't have to be both of them.

02:47.880 --> 02:49.610
So this condition is false.

02:49.620 --> 02:52.280
As you can see only that condition is true.

02:52.380 --> 02:53.900
But one of the two is true.

02:53.910 --> 02:58.680
That's why the statement here is printed so we can simply check that like this.

02:58.680 --> 03:11.470
Print age less than 30 and print Page Creator equal 40 foot print that we see it's false and true.

03:11.580 --> 03:15.750
But as long as one of them is true this will be executed.

03:17.680 --> 03:24.210
Or we also can do is we can store whether a statement is true or not inside of a variable and we've

03:24.210 --> 03:27.820
seen that before but now let's check it out in a different version.

03:27.960 --> 03:34.800
So above below 30 more on a score 30 is going to be the name of my variable and in there I want to store

03:35.220 --> 03:39.950
H creator equal 30.

03:40.010 --> 03:49.250
Now I can print that out and it's print above 30 onto our console and you can see it's true here.

03:49.300 --> 03:49.840
Why is that.

03:49.860 --> 03:57.890
Well that's because this statement here returns true and the return is stored within this variable.

03:57.900 --> 04:00.740
That's why we get this true here.

04:02.010 --> 04:02.960
And why is it true.

04:03.000 --> 04:07.490
Well because age is 45 as you have seen here.

04:07.680 --> 04:17.090
So if we set H in this and the line be above page 225 and we execute the code as you can see it's dated

04:17.130 --> 04:19.620
as follows.

04:19.620 --> 04:26.490
Now we can of course go ahead and create another variable or assign 25 to age even though we did that

04:26.490 --> 04:26.700
here.

04:26.710 --> 04:28.820
But I'm going to just do it in the cell as well.

04:29.010 --> 04:36.600
And I'm going to say something like above 20 is going to be the name of the variable and it's going

04:36.600 --> 04:47.660
to state something like age greater equal 20 and we're going to print above 20 onto the console and

04:47.660 --> 04:49.090
as it concedes that's true.

04:49.110 --> 04:54.560
Now you could of course argue if somebody is just 20 then he's not going to be above 20 but.

04:54.800 --> 04:57.570
Well it depends on the point of view here I say.

04:57.890 --> 05:06.990
So if this condition is true so if H is greater equal 20 I just want to print something on a console

05:07.360 --> 05:11.460
if statement was executed.

05:11.610 --> 05:18.870
So as you can see we can still use the same approach as before so I can check something greater equal

05:19.260 --> 05:23.560
20 and then print something.

05:23.950 --> 05:28.220
Now why do I show you that because we have seen that quite a lot already right.

05:28.390 --> 05:35.140
Well there is something about if statements that you can do and that is to just tell them whether they

05:35.140 --> 05:37.190
are true or false straight away.

05:37.330 --> 05:38.870
So if true.

05:39.100 --> 05:42.020
Print Hi there.

05:42.150 --> 05:42.970
Simple as that.

05:43.180 --> 05:45.490
As you can see Heidi is printed.

05:45.670 --> 05:48.820
So you don't even have to have a comparison.

05:48.820 --> 05:52.240
You can even say straight away it's true or it's false.

05:52.240 --> 05:55.030
So if false and it's not printed.

05:55.240 --> 06:00.310
Of course that doesn't make that much sense but in some cases you might want to use this approach.

06:00.820 --> 06:02.610
So let's look at that a little closer.

06:02.680 --> 06:10.090
So I'm just going to add some more lines so that I can write in the center of the screen so I'm going

06:10.090 --> 06:14.650
to use print and just use True and true.

06:14.650 --> 06:17.860
So guess what it's going to execute well it's going to say true.

06:17.980 --> 06:18.870
Why is that.

06:18.880 --> 06:21.080
Because both of them are true.

06:21.130 --> 06:24.540
So the left hand side is true and the right hand side is true.

06:25.040 --> 06:25.310
OK.

06:25.320 --> 06:30.780
What if I have the situation where I have true and false.

06:30.820 --> 06:32.040
Let's check that out.

06:32.080 --> 06:39.530
As you can see I get false now print false and true.

06:39.830 --> 06:40.830
What will that execute.

06:40.870 --> 06:51.670
Well it will execute falls once again and then the last one print false and false and that one will

06:51.670 --> 06:53.050
give me false as well.

06:53.050 --> 07:00.340
So whenever you use and there is only one combination where it actually is returning true and that is

07:00.340 --> 07:04.270
if both left and right of the end is true.

07:04.270 --> 07:08.870
So both conditions left and right and in this case we're just using the true key word.

07:09.120 --> 07:09.740
All right.

07:10.060 --> 07:11.530
So that's with the end.

07:11.530 --> 07:18.450
Now let's check it out for the OR or so just use print.

07:18.870 --> 07:27.510
True or true that will return true of course because either word is true and if both are true then it's

07:27.510 --> 07:28.560
double true.

07:28.890 --> 07:31.680
But still it's only returning one true of course.

07:31.890 --> 07:41.280
And then in the next line print true or false or will that return while it will return true as well

07:42.000 --> 07:52.680
and print false or true that will return true as well so you can see there is only one combination where

07:52.680 --> 07:54.100
it actually returns false.

07:54.120 --> 08:02.400
And that is if false is the case for both sides so left and right or so to shake that out as you can

08:02.400 --> 08:04.280
see now we get false.

08:04.290 --> 08:09.470
So that's very important logic that you need to understand if you use or or.

08:09.470 --> 08:13.570
And now let's look at an example.

08:13.620 --> 08:20.020
Again let's say we have a variable called country and it's just going to have the county code like us.

08:20.020 --> 08:24.530
United States of America and a variable called age.

08:24.720 --> 08:29.340
And now we check something like Kountry equal equal us.

08:29.970 --> 08:31.950
If that's still true that's the case.

08:31.950 --> 08:50.880
And the H is greater equal 21 or if the country is not us and the age is created equal 18 because in

08:50.880 --> 08:58.350
most countries you may do stuff that is only allowed 21 in the U.S. for example.

08:58.920 --> 09:05.090
This person may drink alcohol.

09:05.960 --> 09:10.720
So in the U.S. you're only allowed to drink alcohol at the age of 21 and higher.

09:10.800 --> 09:15.930
And in other countries I'm not going to say in all countries but in most countries you're allowed to

09:15.930 --> 09:20.180
drink alcohol at the age of 18 or in some countries.

09:20.570 --> 09:25.890
Not that hard article like beer and wine and stuff like that is allowed to drink at what you're allowed

09:25.890 --> 09:27.390
to drink at 16.

09:27.390 --> 09:33.900
So in Germany for example you're allowed to drink beer and wine at the age of 16.

09:34.020 --> 09:41.550
And yeah you may not drink and drive of course and you also may not drive at the age of 16 which is

09:41.550 --> 09:42.720
the case in the US.

09:42.780 --> 09:49.020
So it's pretty interesting how different countries handle those rules differently in the same way of

09:49.050 --> 09:54.570
weapons so you may have a weapon before you may drink in the U.S. and Germany it's super difficult to

09:54.570 --> 09:55.650
even get a weapon.

09:55.890 --> 09:59.190
But it's super easy to get alcohol even if you're just 16.

09:59.430 --> 10:02.420
So that's very interesting.

10:02.580 --> 10:09.690
And that's just an example let's just print that out and a console and have an arrow somewhere says

10:09.710 --> 10:14.060
counter's not defiant and it should be country.

10:14.060 --> 10:15.270
All right.

10:15.270 --> 10:17.580
So I wrote counter here.

10:17.580 --> 10:18.680
Now let's check it out again.

10:18.690 --> 10:20.280
Let's execute the code.

10:20.400 --> 10:21.870
And as you can see it doesn't.

10:21.870 --> 10:23.240
Executed.

10:23.250 --> 10:28.020
Now let's add an else here and let's print something.

10:28.020 --> 10:31.580
Actually we need the colon print.

10:31.590 --> 10:36.740
This person may not drink alcohol.

10:37.650 --> 10:38.510
That's good that.

10:38.520 --> 10:41.850
And as you see this person may not drink alcohol is executed.

10:41.850 --> 10:46.000
That's because the person is from the U.S. that say the person is 25 now.

10:46.020 --> 10:48.420
And as you can see the person may drink alcohol.

10:48.450 --> 10:56.940
Now let's say the person is from G-B from Great Britain and is 18 and as you can see this person may

10:56.940 --> 11:04.520
drink alcohol just because he's from Great Britain and equal or older than 18.

11:05.040 --> 11:08.220
All right so that was booleans and into or.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.430
And we will use those quite a lot.

11:10.440 --> 11:16.440
So make sure that that you have understood quite well and of course there will be exercises where I

11:16.440 --> 11:18.590
can prove that and prove that to yourself.

11:18.810 --> 11:19.090
Great.

11:19.090 --> 11:25.050
So let's check out the sheet in the next video and afterwards you'll see of course and of course the

11:25.050 --> 11:26.100
solution to that.

11:26.250 --> 11:29.310
And afterwards we're going to look at the in operator.

11:29.310 --> 11:32.060
So see you in the next video is.
