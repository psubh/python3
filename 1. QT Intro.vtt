Welcome to the introduction of cute now you might wonder what is cute and why is that cute.

00:06.360 --> 00:12.480
Well it's cute because it's going to help us to create two girls very easily and use Python for that.

00:12.630 --> 00:15.240
So this is a little outlook.

00:15.240 --> 00:20.460
What we are going to develop in this chapter so what you're going to be able to do yourself within roughly

00:20.460 --> 00:22.100
two hours one and a half two hours.

00:22.290 --> 00:27.270
And this is a student manager where you can pretty much see or have a table here where we can easily

00:27.270 --> 00:28.470
create new entries.

00:28.470 --> 00:34.380
We can save the data in a file we can read the data for me sees the file.

00:34.440 --> 00:40.530
So it's pretty much a student manager and we're going to create Now cute is meanwhile released and version

00:40.530 --> 00:41.120
5.

00:41.150 --> 00:45.090
Oh it's an extensive GUI framework for C++.

00:45.110 --> 00:50.740
Now you might say another C++ developer I don't want to learn C++ I want to work with Python.

00:50.910 --> 00:58.440
Well you can develop real world applications with it and not just with C++ but also with Python and

00:58.500 --> 01:03.960
these applications and work on make Linux and Windows so they are cross-platform pretty cool.

01:03.960 --> 01:08.160
Pretty good thing you can pretty much create desktop applications with cute.

01:08.430 --> 01:14.910
And this is an example of what the UI looks like and of course we're going to see the UI very soon.

01:14.910 --> 01:21.700
So this is the tool cued creator which we're going to use in order to drag and drop our UI elements

01:21.780 --> 01:26.820
and in order to make some changes to the UI change of properties and those kind of things so it's going

01:26.820 --> 01:33.760
to be rather easy to do a lot of dragging and some changing not that much code required actually.

01:34.200 --> 01:37.340
And how does it work with Python.

01:37.410 --> 01:44.050
Well if we want to develop the program in Python wouldn't it be cool to access code from Python.

01:44.070 --> 01:47.440
Well yes it is cool or it would be cool and it is possible.

01:47.610 --> 01:50.250
So the framework cute itself is written C++.

01:50.250 --> 01:55.950
As I already told you but its functionality can be called from Python.

01:55.950 --> 02:02.640
Now you have Python and you have cute and there are two ways of using qued with Python and one is called

02:02.670 --> 02:06.440
Paiute which is under the GPL licensing.

02:06.780 --> 02:15.400
And the other one is pie side and on under LGPL in order to find out more about what GPL and LGPL is

02:15.420 --> 02:22.290
you can of course always read through that and Google is just pretty much two different ways of licensing

02:22.290 --> 02:29.900
your programs and code if you license something with Paiute and you don't own the paid version of Pi

02:29.910 --> 02:32.010
qued which is rather expensive.

02:32.370 --> 02:38.580
And then you have to open your code or then you have to make your code open source.

02:38.580 --> 02:40.950
If you use pi side you dont have to do that.

02:41.130 --> 02:49.020
But Paiute is a more extended or older version that allows us to use this approach where we can just

02:49.020 --> 02:56.220
use Python in order to work with cute and PI side is a little younger but its under LGPL so you a bit

02:56.790 --> 03:03.960
freer in the ways you use your software and in the ways that you publish your software and make it.

03:04.340 --> 03:06.360
I paid software for example.

03:06.560 --> 03:07.290
OK.

03:07.400 --> 03:10.380
Now there are two different ways to control.

03:10.490 --> 03:11.100
From pie.

03:11.130 --> 03:13.870
And those were the ones that we have just seen.

03:13.980 --> 03:17.410
And the solution to use both of them is cute pie.

03:17.640 --> 03:24.470
So you have pie cute and then you have cute pie and cube pie is allowing you to use both the solutions.

03:24.510 --> 03:31.120
So both those that you have seen heres this one pie qued and pie side.

03:31.760 --> 03:37.620
OK so the cool thing is no matter which way is installed on your system you can both use both of those

03:37.620 --> 03:40.430
ways and you will select one.

03:40.590 --> 03:44.280
And our application can be run very easily with this.

03:45.060 --> 03:51.040
Now in the next lesson we will install cute and all of the tools that we need for this.

03:51.080 --> 03:57.180
And then we will develop a small real desktop application with cute and Python.

03:57.510 --> 03:59.350
So I hope you enjoy this chapter.

03:59.640 --> 04:05.610
And yeah its pretty much Finally something where we can use the code that we have learned and developed

04:05.610 --> 04:09.310
so far and make graphical user interface solutions with it.

04:09.330 --> 04:14.340
So we actually have a desktop application where we can see something we have buttons that you can press

04:14.610 --> 04:17.850
and you have text that can be displayed in a nice way and so forth.

04:17.850 --> 04:20.460
So go ahead and see in the next video.
