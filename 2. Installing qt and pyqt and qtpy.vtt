00:00.620 --> 00:06.340
Come back and this video we are going to install cute and you can find cute and cute that I O.

00:06.450 --> 00:09.050
And then you just visit the download page.

00:09.090 --> 00:14.100
So click the link on the top right corner and once you're there you can choose between two different

00:14.100 --> 00:14.640
versions.

00:14.640 --> 00:19.800
The commercial one where you have a free trial where you can use a free trial or the open source one

00:19.800 --> 00:26.550
which is completely free in general and you have some advantages in the commercial version over the

00:26.550 --> 00:31.410
open source version but the open source version is going to be enough for what we want to do.

00:31.410 --> 00:39.390
Now what you need to do is to always check the GPL v3 license and it has to be in your code as well

00:39.400 --> 00:47.430
so when you use cutesie or cute you need to make your software open source as well at least to a certain

00:47.430 --> 00:47.820
degree.

00:47.820 --> 00:52.050
And if you want to know more about it ask your lawyer or check out the legal documents.

00:52.050 --> 00:56.180
I'm not a lawyer so I'm not going to tell you in detail what you can or cannot do.

00:56.310 --> 00:58.770
I'm just going to show you how to use this tool.

00:58.770 --> 01:04.410
All right so then once you have decided which version you want to use you can just go open source or

01:04.440 --> 01:10.650
try free as it can see you can start with one in five fifty nine dollars a month using qued.

01:10.650 --> 01:17.880
So it has to be for very award it has to bring you a lot of value in order to pay this amount based

01:17.880 --> 01:19.410
on of course what you use it for.

01:19.410 --> 01:25.920
So if you're running a business then this might be a valid prize but if you just want to learn how to

01:25.920 --> 01:27.530
use it then this is too expensive.

01:27.530 --> 01:31.120
So we're just going to go for the open source version here.

01:31.380 --> 01:36.930
So I'm just going to select that and then I can select the download.

01:36.930 --> 01:42.720
So as you can see just download it here you can of course see if you're installing under a cute open

01:42.720 --> 01:44.180
source license.

01:44.190 --> 01:51.510
Please be sure you are fully comply or full compliance with the legal obligation of the GPL 2 3 before

01:51.510 --> 01:52.590
installation.

01:52.590 --> 01:54.240
So check that out.

01:54.330 --> 01:57.760
And once you download it you will have to accept it.

01:57.930 --> 02:04.110
So once I'm here I'm just going to download the X-File and I'm going to start the process right away

02:06.030 --> 02:12.360
and once I'm here I can again read through all the different texts and the one that we want to do.

02:12.360 --> 02:14.160
Or to button that we want to press next.

02:14.160 --> 02:15.540
Now you can log in.

02:15.690 --> 02:22.190
But as I don't have an account I'm just going to skip that and go X again.

02:22.380 --> 02:27.780
You can change the settings but we will have to change settings later on as well so just press next

02:27.780 --> 02:33.180
and wait until the middle order is received and it will take a little while as well.

02:33.180 --> 02:39.500
In general this application installation takes quite a bit and you can run to run into errors.

02:39.540 --> 02:41.470
It can crash if that happens.

02:41.480 --> 02:43.950
And try the installation process once again.

02:44.100 --> 02:51.210
And if that doesn't happen either then just check out the support of cute or just check out stack overflow

02:51.660 --> 02:54.680
because it's not unlikely to happen.

02:54.810 --> 03:01.050
Then you can select an installation folder and I'm just going to go for the full one which is cute and

03:01.620 --> 03:03.530
then I just press on next.

03:03.750 --> 03:11.890
So here we can select the components that we want to install and I'm going to install the queued version.

03:11.910 --> 03:14.360
That is a top so the highest version.

03:14.460 --> 03:16.700
But here I don't need to install everything.

03:16.740 --> 03:20.340
We only need to install one particular file from here.

03:20.340 --> 03:27.700
As you can see there is Android's pre-built components for Android A-R him the X 86 version and so forth.

03:27.840 --> 03:34.710
So there is plenty to install if you want to but it's going to be huge so it's going to take up thirty

03:34.710 --> 03:36.180
three point four four gigabyte.

03:36.180 --> 03:37.800
In my case just install that.

03:37.950 --> 03:44.940
So I'm not going to do that but I'm going to install the Mingy w 30 bit version that I have selected

03:44.940 --> 03:47.030
right here.

03:47.030 --> 03:47.360
All right.

03:47.370 --> 03:54.360
So just select and Mendon GW and just select the latest version so that's totally fine you don't need

03:54.360 --> 04:01.490
to install any preview version just use a cutesie with the latest version here and there.

04:01.650 --> 04:07.770
Selectman GW there is one more thing that we need to install under tools so scroll down and there you

04:07.770 --> 04:15.640
will find tools and hear what we want to install is exactly what is selected or pre-selected here.

04:15.780 --> 04:17.970
To create or 4.7.

04:18.080 --> 04:22.250
Zero see DB debugger support and does pretty much it.

04:22.250 --> 04:24.690
So once you have that you can press next.

04:24.750 --> 04:29.070
Here you have to read through the two licenses and accept them.

04:29.070 --> 04:37.350
So very important you have to understand what you have read so read through it and once you're fine

04:37.350 --> 04:37.650
with it.

04:37.650 --> 04:43.770
Only if you agree of course you have to select the agree button or checkbox and then you can press next.

04:43.770 --> 04:49.140
Now you can give it a name and I'm just going to call it cute and I was ready to install so I'm just

04:49.140 --> 04:52.560
going to press install and that will now take quite a bit.

04:52.660 --> 04:57.300
And based on how many options you have installed or you are installing it it's going to take a little

04:57.300 --> 04:58.060
more even.

04:58.230 --> 05:03.870
So I'm just going to cut the video and where I'm done install or I'm done downloading and installing

05:03.870 --> 05:06.600
this process.

05:07.290 --> 05:08.030
All righty.

05:08.070 --> 05:13.300
Once we hear them we can either launch the cute creator or we cannot.

05:13.350 --> 05:16.050
But what we need to launch is Anaconda.

05:16.080 --> 05:27.830
So open up an icon navigator because we will need to install cute there so let me open up Anaconda wants

05:27.930 --> 05:28.950
on a condo opens up.

05:28.950 --> 05:30.620
You go to your environment.

05:30.750 --> 05:34.460
And here we need to update our channels.

05:34.650 --> 05:44.280
So go to channels and make sure that you add the kind up for each condom minus forge and then press

05:44.280 --> 05:51.340
up the channels you go to channels and then you check whether you have Konda minus for each as a channel.

05:51.390 --> 05:56.880
And if you don't and press the red button at the top right of this pop up that you put comes up and

05:57.300 --> 05:58.060
enter the text.

05:58.070 --> 06:03.360
Press enter and then update the channels and that will update your channels here and it can take quite

06:03.360 --> 06:04.260
a while.

06:04.770 --> 06:15.290
And once that is done you should go to all and search for cutesie and you will find Pyi why T and q

06:15.420 --> 06:20.170
TDY and those two should be installed or you should install them if they aren't.

06:20.190 --> 06:23.430
So in case they aren't just check the box here.

06:24.600 --> 06:33.410
And Press mark for insulation and once you have done that that can again take a little while and yeah

06:34.050 --> 06:44.170
soon as you enter qued here or P-E why cutey and you find this cute TV installed and cute Hawaiian style.

06:44.220 --> 06:45.870
You're good to go.

06:46.500 --> 06:46.860
All right.

06:46.860 --> 06:52.690
By that point you're ready for cute and your installation is ready so we can go ahead and use cute.

06:52.740 --> 06:56.230
And we'll do that in the following video so see you there.
