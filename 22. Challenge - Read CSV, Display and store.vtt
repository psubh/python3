Work I'm back in this video.

00:01.970 --> 00:03.920
I have a little challenge for you.

00:03.930 --> 00:12.030
So for the next few videos you should pretty much create a student manager which contains a bunch of

00:12.030 --> 00:14.270
students and their names.

00:14.280 --> 00:18.590
And of course also their major or the subject that they study.

00:18.720 --> 00:24.360
So pretty much the same thing that we have here you should have a table here table widget.

00:24.420 --> 00:27.060
Then you should have two buttons here instead of one.

00:27.090 --> 00:31.230
They should be next to each other and the user interface should be similar to what we have here where

00:31.530 --> 00:39.120
you can drag it to a certain way and it's still going to look OK or pretty good and the left button

00:39.120 --> 00:44.790
should be a safe button and the right button should be a real button where you can pretty much add a

00:44.790 --> 00:51.530
new row to your table here and the table should be populated based on a c v file.

00:51.540 --> 00:57.690
So you will need this is the module and it should pretty much reach a file which looks similar to what

00:57.690 --> 00:58.400
we have here.

00:58.410 --> 01:04.260
John Doe informatics Michael Moore mathematics and those kind of things so should pretty much read that

01:04.510 --> 01:05.750
populate the table.

01:05.910 --> 01:12.130
And then once we make a change in the table and pressed save the C's the file should be updated.

01:12.180 --> 01:17.770
So you will need to figure out how to read data from your table.

01:17.820 --> 01:23.460
You can of course use the documentation for that but I will also give you some more hints in the next

01:23.460 --> 01:30.400
video so if you feel like checking out the documentation you can skip the hints or skip the next video.

01:30.570 --> 01:36.090
And if you want to see that you can of course check out the video for some more hints.

01:36.090 --> 01:36.470
All right.

01:36.480 --> 01:41.950
So good luck with this exercise and see you in the simple solution with your.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.100
Well if you can do it easily then you can of course skip those as well.

01:46.380 --> 01:48.410
So see you in the next video.
