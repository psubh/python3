00:00.250 --> 00:05.760
And this video we are going to look into data conversion and that's an important thing to understand

00:05.790 --> 00:12.300
because sometimes you get data in a specific version or in a specific type and you need it in a different

00:12.300 --> 00:18.150
type to go on with your program and I will make a lot more sense as soon as we get more complex programs.

00:18.150 --> 00:24.450
But here it already is quite easy to understand because we're going to look into converting a string

00:24.450 --> 00:29.970
into an integer which is a whole number a string into a floating point number which is going to be a

00:29.970 --> 00:30.460
float.

00:30.480 --> 00:35.250
And then how to convert from an integer to a number which we already have seen.

00:35.250 --> 00:38.720
But just for completion because we're going to cover that.

00:38.940 --> 00:43.770
So let's go ahead and create a variable called a and that will contain the value of 5.

00:44.010 --> 00:47.190
And to be to contain the value of 6.

00:47.280 --> 00:52.950
Let's say we get that as a input from a user because if a user type something with his keyboard for

00:52.950 --> 00:56.230
example then that will be a string usually.

00:56.280 --> 00:58.840
User input is usually stored as a string.

00:59.010 --> 01:04.920
And then if you want to use that as a number in order to calculate correctly you will need to convert

01:04.920 --> 01:05.510
that.

01:05.520 --> 01:08.010
So let's have a look at printing that out for us.

01:08.010 --> 01:12.190
So let's print a plus b first.

01:12.240 --> 01:13.740
So I'm going to run that.

01:13.740 --> 01:16.980
And as you can see it's 56.

01:16.980 --> 01:19.110
So five plus six is 56.

01:19.110 --> 01:20.680
Very easy math right.

01:20.700 --> 01:21.560
That's not correct.

01:21.570 --> 01:24.540
It's just putting those two strings next to each other.

01:24.540 --> 01:31.860
So we have the two strings and if we add them next or concatenate them they get this 56.

01:31.860 --> 01:38.220
So if you want to change that if you want to actually get five plus six as a numbers added to each other

01:38.550 --> 01:40.850
then you need to convert that.

01:40.980 --> 01:49.500
And in order to convert a string into an integer so into a whole number you need to go ahead and use

01:49.740 --> 01:51.330
the int function.

01:51.480 --> 01:58.180
So there is this function called high end to your end which converts an string into an integer.

01:58.380 --> 02:01.950
So now let's check it out again and we get the result of 11.

02:01.950 --> 02:09.210
So what happened here is that both of our values which were strings before of are A and B variables

02:09.540 --> 02:14.170
they were strings before but now we treat them as integers.

02:14.340 --> 02:16.230
So we convert them into integers.

02:16.230 --> 02:23.580
And that's why adding them to each other will simply apply the mathematical approach of just summation

02:23.760 --> 02:26.150
which gives us this resolve of 11.

02:26.160 --> 02:32.610
Now if we want to do the same thing with protein point numbers because for example if we enter 5.5 and

02:32.610 --> 02:36.890
6.5 in here and tried to run that then we get this error.

02:37.110 --> 02:44.820
It says Invalid literal for it with base 10 5.5 so it doesn't understand what is five point five is

02:44.820 --> 02:51.180
supposed to mean in this context so it's not it doesn't know how to convert that because it can convert

02:51.180 --> 02:55.030
it into an integer because integers only understand whole numbers.

02:55.080 --> 02:59.160
So if you want to use that then you need to use a different approach.

02:59.340 --> 03:05.300
So let's say we have those five point five and B is going to be six point five.

03:05.490 --> 03:07.290
But again as strings.

03:07.320 --> 03:11.250
So with the end of quotation marks we can see now they are strings.

03:11.490 --> 03:19.830
If we print that and we want to have them as float then we want to or we have to use the float function.

03:19.830 --> 03:23.080
So I'm going to say float a plus float b.

03:23.400 --> 03:30.430
And what that will do is it will add them next to each other in a mathematical approach.

03:30.480 --> 03:39.870
If we wouldn't have used that if we just said a plus be a plus b then we get five point five six point

03:39.870 --> 03:43.970
five because it just concatenates the two strings to each other.

03:44.180 --> 03:48.360
But then the other approach was with the floats and that's the one.

03:48.360 --> 03:53.280
And if you use that then you use the correct mathematical calculation here.

03:53.280 --> 04:01.500
Now if you want to go ahead and use an integer but as a string This is actually a string integer to

04:01.500 --> 04:02.320
a string.

04:02.430 --> 04:04.630
Then you can go ahead and do the following.

04:04.650 --> 04:20.220
So let's say the age is 30 and we want to print something like high speed plus H plus years old something

04:20.240 --> 04:21.080
like that.

04:21.120 --> 04:22.620
If we run that we can do it.

04:22.620 --> 04:27.540
It says must be s are not I.A. so must be a string not an integer.

04:27.540 --> 04:29.010
We had that before right.

04:29.160 --> 04:31.260
And you probably know how to solve that.

04:31.440 --> 04:42.210
And that is by using the as t r or string function which converts the integer h into a string.

04:42.210 --> 04:46.640
Now if we run that again we see I am 30 years old.

04:47.220 --> 04:50.970
So now you've seen how to use it with very basic types.

04:51.210 --> 04:52.900
And I can solve that or there.

04:53.190 --> 04:59.220
But there is also something to consider when using lists so we can just convert them in the same way

04:59.240 --> 05:04.480
that we did here we have to use a different approach and that's what we're going to look into and the

05:04.480 --> 05:05.230
next video.

05:05.260 --> 05:06.720
So see you there.
