Welcome to the lists chapter in this chapter we're going to talk about lists but also dictionaries and

00:05.460 --> 00:05.970
tuples.

00:05.970 --> 00:10.470
But first of all let's have a look at what we are still lacking with lists.

00:10.470 --> 00:12.980
So the problem is we already know this.

00:13.050 --> 00:17.220
At least that's what you could say because we have worked with this quite a bit.

00:17.400 --> 00:25.290
But for example how do we get the first 10 participants 10 entries off a list or the last 10 or how

00:25.290 --> 00:32.060
do we get the first character of each element in the list or whatever you can think of according lists.

00:32.070 --> 00:39.270
So we have done some things but there is still plenty to learn and we are going to use something called

00:40.020 --> 00:42.540
slicing lists slicing.

00:42.540 --> 00:49.980
And this is a functionality that will allow us to do this kind of thing so to slice a list into multiple

00:49.980 --> 00:50.880
pieces.

00:50.880 --> 00:55.200
And I'd say let's get started and look into this.
