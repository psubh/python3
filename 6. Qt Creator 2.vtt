00:00.540 --> 00:05.110
Welcome back in this video we're going to look at a cute creator a little more.

00:05.160 --> 00:10.980
And in order to do so I'm just going to get rid of all the elements that I had in here.

00:10.980 --> 00:14.480
So I will just select them all on this site.

00:14.490 --> 00:16.750
So it's inside of the central widget.

00:17.070 --> 00:27.210
I have pretty much all of my stuff so if I select the central widget and then I select everything in

00:27.210 --> 00:32.500
that central widget then I can just deleted by right clicking and pressing delete.

00:32.580 --> 00:34.580
And as you can see now everything is gone.

00:34.580 --> 00:40.470
My central widget which is of the classic queue widget doesn't contain anything anymore.

00:40.800 --> 00:43.940
Now there is a hierarchy here and there.

00:44.050 --> 00:50.280
It's pretty much just main window which is this whole window which contains a menu bar which contains

00:50.340 --> 00:54.210
a status bar and other objects in here.

00:54.330 --> 00:56.960
So there for class queue status bar.

00:56.970 --> 00:59.590
This one has a class queue toolbar and so forth.

00:59.610 --> 01:04.280
So if you wanted to do all of those you could develop those with those class names.

01:04.490 --> 01:09.810
But what I want to talk to you about a little more are the properties here on the right bottom site.

01:10.050 --> 01:14.630
So in order to do that I'm actually going to use a text label.

01:14.820 --> 01:17.240
So I'm just going to drag it in here.

01:17.610 --> 01:23.940
Make it a little bigger and if you look at it here on the right hand side the geometry changes each

01:23.940 --> 01:26.310
time that I change the value.

01:26.610 --> 01:32.370
But what I actually want to talk to you about are several of those elements that you can see here.

01:32.370 --> 01:38.250
So there are plenty of properties and there are many as I you've seen so there is this text which you

01:38.250 --> 01:45.340
can see here its text label so I can press here and change that to Hello World in here.

01:45.450 --> 01:50.940
But I can also change it in here in the top but in the bottom right corner I can just change the value

01:50.940 --> 01:52.970
to Hello World 23.

01:53.130 --> 01:59.460
So as you can see there is a specific hierarchy here which we don't see as a hierarchy.

01:59.460 --> 02:05.030
We have this q label which inherits from Q frame which inherits from Q widget which inherits from Q

02:05.040 --> 02:06.030
object.

02:06.030 --> 02:09.720
So this q object just has the object name.

02:09.720 --> 02:18.030
So if we wanted to work with this object name so pretty much with this label here we could change its

02:18.090 --> 02:21.840
ID so this is pretty much the ID of that label.

02:21.840 --> 02:29.850
So for example if you have a button and you want to adjust the button text based on a click or based

02:29.850 --> 02:36.780
on behavior in your code you would access its object name or the existing button via object name.

02:36.900 --> 02:42.200
And that's why it's important to have a descriptive name here so this is just called label.

02:42.330 --> 02:43.990
But we could call this one.

02:44.010 --> 02:45.820
Hello world.

02:45.840 --> 02:47.550
A label for example.

02:47.910 --> 02:49.710
So that's the name of the object.

02:49.770 --> 02:55.350
Then there is this queue widget which pretty much contains things like the geometry the minimum size

02:55.400 --> 02:56.690
the maximum size.

02:56.690 --> 03:03.590
You can change to font in here so if I feel like it using a different font I can do that any time.

03:03.720 --> 03:07.980
So let's use Ibrahima as it can see the font has changed.

03:07.980 --> 03:11.630
Then you can change to point size which pretty much is the font size.

03:11.640 --> 03:13.890
So I'm going to make it a little bigger here.

03:14.130 --> 03:16.290
Let's go with 18.

03:16.320 --> 03:25.110
Maybe some like that we are can make it bold italic underlined So pretty much everything can be changed

03:25.110 --> 03:26.010
in here.

03:26.010 --> 03:29.410
So you have plenty of settings that you can change.

03:29.520 --> 03:35.580
You can add a tooltip which we have done in the past so you can just add a tooltip when somebody hovers

03:35.580 --> 03:37.550
over it however.

03:38.040 --> 03:45.540
So let's say I added to to called hovered here then plenty of other properties so you can go through

03:45.540 --> 03:50.700
all of them and check them out of course but you will need most of them you want only some of them.

03:50.700 --> 03:55.440
For example changing the appearance of it and changing the minimum size.

03:55.440 --> 04:02.460
For example if you don't want this to be smaller than a certain size So for example your label shouldn't

04:02.460 --> 04:06.640
be smaller than say 50 pixels wide or something like that.

04:06.690 --> 04:12.870
Then the geometry you can change at any time so here the x value here is pretty much how much distance

04:12.870 --> 04:13.750
does it have.

04:14.070 --> 04:16.000
To the left corner.

04:16.320 --> 04:19.960
And this y values how much distance does it have to the top.

04:20.100 --> 04:22.070
Which is pretty much starting here.

04:22.230 --> 04:28.420
So let's say I changed a value to 100 pixels you can see that my hello world is moving.

04:28.620 --> 04:34.140
Then we have the Q frame which contains some properties and finally the Q label.

04:34.140 --> 04:37.180
So here we are talking about the label itself.

04:37.260 --> 04:40.150
So the properties that we had in the Q widget.

04:40.320 --> 04:42.330
They are all the same for all widgets.

04:42.330 --> 04:49.560
Pretty much so everything there is a widget does have those properties but only the Q label has the

04:49.560 --> 04:54.910
label properties so we have some that are specific for this label.

04:54.960 --> 05:03.220
Of course other objects from here other widgets could contain similar elements like the ones that you

05:03.220 --> 05:04.390
can see here.

05:04.390 --> 05:09.310
This set of properties is pretty much set for the CULE label.

05:09.680 --> 05:14.640
And yeah you can change some things like a margin.

05:14.650 --> 05:16.120
So let's add a margin.

05:16.120 --> 05:17.810
Here you can see no.

05:17.970 --> 05:21.220
I have a margin of 200 So that's a lot too a little too much.

05:21.430 --> 05:24.390
So there's no nothing in there anymore.

05:24.730 --> 05:33.580
You can add a word wrap so I can see now repping it to the next line in order to fit the text.

05:33.590 --> 05:36.970
That's what this word rep does and so forth.

05:37.330 --> 05:37.720
OK.

05:37.730 --> 05:42.800
So again you can of course check out everything in here but what I want to show you is actually how

05:42.800 --> 05:53.940
this is structured so let's go back to PI charm and I'm just going to show you how it is structure so

05:53.950 --> 05:59.330
that can create a new life and file I'm just going to call it test because I just want to show you some

05:59.330 --> 06:07.280
pseudo code which is not really existing in python but it exists in C++ because as you know qued is

06:07.370 --> 06:09.310
written in C++.

06:09.320 --> 06:17.300
So Howard pretty much works as we have this class called queue object which for just was just going

06:17.300 --> 06:26.360
to pass then we have this class called queue widget which inherits from queue object and here I'm going

06:26.360 --> 06:27.380
to pass as well.

06:27.400 --> 06:35.630
Then we have this class called queue frame which inherits from Q widget and I'm going to pass here as

06:35.630 --> 06:36.350
well.

06:36.620 --> 06:43.100
And finally we have this class queue label which inherits from Q frame.

06:43.100 --> 06:47.420
So you see that's how the relationship is.

06:47.870 --> 06:52.460
So object then widget frame label.

06:52.490 --> 06:58.010
And if we're if we're not talking about a label if we're talking about a different object so a different

06:58.010 --> 07:01.400
widget or different.

07:01.400 --> 07:03.200
For example here button or something.

07:03.200 --> 07:05.370
Let's have a look at the button real quick.

07:05.450 --> 07:12.800
So let me drag in a button then we can see the hierarchy here as well so queue object queue widget and

07:12.800 --> 07:18.880
that inherits or then you have to abstract button which inherits from key widget and you have q push

07:18.880 --> 07:22.730
button which then again inherits from Q abstract button.

07:22.730 --> 07:28.310
So there is a class called you abstract button which contains pretty much the code for buttons in general.

07:28.310 --> 07:33.110
But then there is the specific button which is called Push button and you can see that if you check

07:33.110 --> 07:39.170
out the tool button here as well you can see that the tool button is also inheriting from Q abstract

07:39.170 --> 07:49.610
button and the same goes for let's say the radio button as you can see here the radio button is an abstract

07:49.610 --> 07:50.310
button.

07:50.450 --> 07:56.270
So the radio button doesn't have an additional cue radio button kind of thing it's just a cue abstract

07:56.270 --> 07:57.450
button.

07:58.240 --> 07:58.860
OK.

07:59.030 --> 08:01.700
So that's just what I wanted to show you here real quick.

08:01.700 --> 08:08.960
Let's go back to our code and let's create some pseudo code in here because what you see here is how

08:08.960 --> 08:11.660
they are pretty much inheriting So what the structure is.

08:11.810 --> 08:18.200
But that is not done in Python so that you won't find this code in Python anywhere in qued it's there

08:18.290 --> 08:20.250
in C++.

08:20.670 --> 08:21.240
OK.

08:21.530 --> 08:28.580
So instead of passing I'm just going to add a little instructor constructor here which is just going

08:28.730 --> 08:31.580
in it self.

08:31.700 --> 08:33.800
And here let's say a change.

08:33.830 --> 08:38.270
You can change the name or you can set the name to something like label.

08:38.750 --> 08:44.460
Then we have this q widget which also has a constructor.

08:45.560 --> 08:49.910
And first of all it calls the constructor of its parent.

08:49.940 --> 08:59.440
So it's just going to use the input from the parent then it's going to set the geometry south'ard geometry.

08:59.870 --> 09:02.330
And this contains a list.

09:02.570 --> 09:04.730
And for now she's going to be an empty list.

09:04.820 --> 09:11.390
Then you have the phone that you can set here and let's say you have the font of arrival and I'm going

09:11.390 --> 09:20.450
to leave the cue frame out because there's not that much interesting stuff for us but the label label

09:20.730 --> 09:21.290
also.

09:21.320 --> 09:34.030
First of all calls the constructor of the parent so super on the score in it then self that text could

09:34.160 --> 09:38.150
said something like the text and say something like Hello world.

09:38.150 --> 09:38.550
All right.

09:38.570 --> 09:45.320
So again this is just pseudo code but that's how you could pretty much imagine what's going on in our

09:45.590 --> 09:47.540
qued creator.

09:47.540 --> 09:50.660
So here we check out our label again.

09:50.660 --> 09:53.070
You see the cue object has an object name.

09:53.090 --> 09:59.600
And now we changed it from label to have the word label then it has a Q widget which has this geometry

09:59.910 --> 10:06.410
where you can see OK this is containing a list in here and so forth.

10:06.410 --> 10:06.870
All right.

10:06.890 --> 10:12.500
So I hope this gave you a little better understanding of what's going on and what is actually happening

10:12.500 --> 10:13.880
in the background here.

10:14.060 --> 10:21.530
And as I said Guruji or qued is written in C++ so you won't find this in python but it's pretty much

10:21.530 --> 10:24.020
the same principle that applies there.

10:24.260 --> 10:31.730
And what we what you should do now what you can do is play around create your own user interface and

10:31.730 --> 10:36.050
then just build it executed and test how it looks like.
