00:00.150 --> 00:04.320
Well come back in this video you are going to learn about comparison operators.

00:04.350 --> 00:06.730
Therefore let's go ahead and use one.

00:06.750 --> 00:14.370
So you can see what a comparison operator is let's say six is less than five.

00:14.370 --> 00:19.080
And if that's the case then just print Yes onto the console.

00:19.080 --> 00:20.570
So let's execute that code.

00:20.640 --> 00:22.470
And as you can see nothing happens.

00:22.590 --> 00:25.410
So it doesn't execute it and why is that.

00:25.410 --> 00:30.860
That is because six is not less than five six is in fact greater than five.

00:31.020 --> 00:38.370
So if we check that out once again with a print statement we would just say six less than five if we

00:38.370 --> 00:43.800
execute that we get false here which means that this statement is false.

00:43.950 --> 00:51.790
And as you already know from the last video the if statement needs to have a condition that is true.

00:51.930 --> 00:54.480
Otherwise it won't execute it's code.

00:54.990 --> 01:00.930
That's why this print statement here with the yes statement is never going to be printed because this

01:00.930 --> 01:03.210
condition here is not true.

01:03.210 --> 01:05.400
So let's check it out with a different one.

01:05.400 --> 01:10.230
Let's check it out with five lower or less than six.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.050
Let's print that.

01:11.070 --> 01:14.350
And as you can see this statement here now is true.

01:14.610 --> 01:24.920
So now if we would use that statement at the top here then we get this printed yes on to our console.

01:25.050 --> 01:26.130
So that's a good thing.

01:26.160 --> 01:31.870
Now we can also use variables in order to store a boolean with him.

01:31.920 --> 01:35.130
So let's say we have B equals false.

01:35.130 --> 01:41.640
So we have this variable and we said it's value to false and here it's important that we use the capital

01:41.640 --> 01:46.720
F as you can see now it's green which indicates that Python understands that this is a boolean.

01:46.770 --> 01:54.540
In this case and now let's print B onto the console just to check and see where B is simply false.

01:54.540 --> 02:01.790
Now what we also can do is we can store an actual comparison in our variable.

02:01.800 --> 02:10.470
So this result variable is going to be the result of five lower six or less than six.

02:10.470 --> 02:20.990
Now if we check results now and we print something on the console something like five is less than six.

02:21.040 --> 02:21.990
Let's do that.

02:22.290 --> 02:25.420
As you can see we get this printed onto the console.

02:25.440 --> 02:26.890
So let's check a different thing.

02:26.940 --> 02:29.600
Let's check result here.

02:29.880 --> 02:31.840
Let's just see what result is.

02:31.890 --> 02:33.150
So let's execute that again.

02:33.150 --> 02:35.200
And as you can see resoled is true.

02:35.310 --> 02:42.750
So result now is a boolean variable which contains a boolean and a boolean only has two values.

02:42.780 --> 02:45.800
It can either be true or it can be false.

02:45.870 --> 02:51.160
So this result here is true because 5 is less than six.

02:51.180 --> 02:56.810
That's why this statement is printing out that code here onto the console.

02:56.950 --> 03:05.040
So you can see the text now less than and greater then are not the only ones that there are there are

03:05.490 --> 03:08.080
equal comparisons as well.

03:08.100 --> 03:16.740
So let's check it out let's print out five double equal five.

03:16.740 --> 03:19.640
Now you might wonder why do we need double equal.

03:19.740 --> 03:28.540
There is because a simple equal one single equal is setting a value and two equal signs.

03:28.590 --> 03:30.450
They compare values.

03:30.450 --> 03:34.550
So when you see double equal that is always a comparison.

03:34.980 --> 03:38.670
And as you can see five equal equal five is true.

03:38.670 --> 03:39.290
Why is that.

03:39.300 --> 03:41.580
Well because five is five.

03:41.850 --> 03:50.070
But if we do something like print five equal equal four then we get false because this statement here

03:50.070 --> 03:50.700
is incorrect.

03:50.700 --> 03:52.150
Five is not four.

03:52.440 --> 03:55.590
It's as simple as that.

03:55.620 --> 04:03.390
Now you can do this also with strings so let's create a word which is just going to be hello very basic

04:03.390 --> 04:08.540
word and we are going to print a word equal equal.

04:09.090 --> 04:10.730
Hello.

04:11.910 --> 04:14.310
Now let's see what happens.

04:14.370 --> 04:16.160
As you can see we get the statement true.

04:16.170 --> 04:20.280
That's because word in fact has the value of hello.

04:20.550 --> 04:22.840
That's why this statement here is true.

04:24.230 --> 04:32.390
Then we can also check out if word is equal equal word.

04:32.460 --> 04:34.380
See if that's true.

04:35.080 --> 04:41.130
And as you can see that's false even if we would use a word with a small or uncapitalized letter.

04:41.310 --> 04:47.330
As you can see it's false that's why it's it's not comparing the name of the word variable.

04:47.420 --> 04:49.060
It's comparing its contents.

04:49.070 --> 04:57.060
So we're comparing the content which is Halo 2 this word content which is not true.

04:57.080 --> 05:00.180
That's why we get this false statement here.

05:00.200 --> 05:06.100
Now we can also do something which is an an equal comparison which means.

05:06.210 --> 05:10.500
So let's use word again which is going to be hello once again.

05:10.520 --> 05:14.660
Actually we didn't need to create that but I'm just going to create it in a different role here or a

05:14.660 --> 05:15.640
different cell.

05:15.650 --> 05:24.290
So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to print word an equal hello and this statement here is going

05:24.290 --> 05:25.000
to be false.

05:25.010 --> 05:25.890
Why is that.

05:25.940 --> 05:31.130
Because we are comparing the content of word and we are asking is it not equal.

05:31.160 --> 05:31.710
Hello.

05:31.880 --> 05:39.890
So an exclamation mark Plus the equal sign will result in a not equal.

05:39.890 --> 05:45.070
So this means not equal and there through we get false.

05:45.110 --> 05:48.050
Let's check it out and we see false.

05:48.050 --> 05:52.730
Now let's do the same with this word example that we had some going to copy and paste that real quick

05:53.070 --> 05:57.070
and I'm going to use an exclamation mark here as well and execute that.

05:57.080 --> 06:04.370
And as you can see this statement now is true because we are saying word is not equal the word word.

06:04.640 --> 06:06.980
And that's why the statement is true.

06:09.230 --> 06:15.950
Now of course you can do the same thing with numbers but how are you going to look at it is greater

06:15.950 --> 06:18.410
or equal or less than equal.

06:18.440 --> 06:25.630
So let's print five less than five on the console and that will give us false.

06:25.880 --> 06:34.530
But if we do something like print five less than equal five we get true.

06:34.580 --> 06:35.500
Why is that.

06:35.600 --> 06:42.310
Because we're checking is five lower or less than or equal five.

06:42.410 --> 06:45.460
It is not less than but it is equal five.

06:45.680 --> 06:48.010
That's why this statement here is true.

06:48.020 --> 06:50.570
So that that's why we get printed.

06:50.570 --> 06:52.840
True onto the con..

06:52.850 --> 06:56.350
Now we can do the same thing with greater then.

06:56.510 --> 07:01.650
So print five creator five that will of course be false.

07:01.880 --> 07:09.550
But then if we say print five creator equal five that will be true.

07:10.010 --> 07:15.860
So that's really important not just for statements but also for loops which we're going to cover later

07:15.860 --> 07:16.400
on.

07:16.400 --> 07:21.890
That's why I wanted to really put an emphasis on comparison operators.
