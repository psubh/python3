00:00.720 --> 00:06.780
Come back in this video I would like to introduce you a little more to this cute creator or give you

00:06.780 --> 00:09.390
some more information about the Skewes creator.

00:09.390 --> 00:15.030
So what I have here are a bunch of layouts and lay outs.

00:15.030 --> 00:19.520
They can allow you to lay out things in a certain way.

00:19.520 --> 00:25.830
So let's say I have this vertical lay out things in there new elements will be displayed vertically

00:25.830 --> 00:26.470
in there.

00:26.730 --> 00:32.160
OK so if I drag something in there let me make this whole vertical lay out a little bigger and by the

00:32.160 --> 00:39.840
way if I can't access the vertical layout by clicking on it I can select it from the right hand side.

00:39.840 --> 00:43.350
So you on the right hand side you can select your elements.

00:43.620 --> 00:47.330
And I just press on the vertical layout and then I can resize it again.

00:47.550 --> 00:48.820
So I'm going to resize it.

00:48.840 --> 00:55.590
OK so you can see very easily I can now change the elements in a vertically vertical way.

00:55.590 --> 01:01.200
You have the grid lay out where you can position things in a grid form where you position the next to

01:01.200 --> 01:02.370
each other as well.

01:02.400 --> 01:07.260
Then you have the horizontal lay up where you can put stuff right next to each other.

01:07.300 --> 01:13.980
This is year does vertical loudest putting of elements on top of each other and then we have for example

01:14.340 --> 01:17.950
some spacers which just create some space in between elements.

01:17.960 --> 01:23.580
And we have buttons and we have seen some of them for example or push button just just a normal button.

01:23.730 --> 01:30.000
Then you have the tool button which can be used in order to open up some more options for example.

01:30.210 --> 01:32.900
Then we have the radio button we have used that one.

01:33.150 --> 01:38.050
So we have just used those radio buttons here on the side.

01:38.070 --> 01:44.900
Then the check box we've seen that as well then yeah there are plenty of different buttons here.

01:44.910 --> 01:47.220
Item views and so forth.

01:47.220 --> 01:51.270
So for example if we check out the containers.

01:51.300 --> 01:56.020
So there are multiple different containers such as a group box for example.

01:56.020 --> 02:01.620
So when a group box will do this it will group elements in there within this group box.

02:01.620 --> 02:08.280
So for example if I want to have a form then I can put all the different elements in here so I can add

02:08.280 --> 02:17.970
something like a text fields or play like an a line edit where a user can enter his username for example.

02:17.970 --> 02:22.200
Then another one word can enter his password and so forth.

02:22.200 --> 02:26.250
So he just put those in here.

02:26.400 --> 02:31.740
Make it a little bigger than a button.

02:31.820 --> 02:38.540
The bottom of it is you can see now this is a group box and I can change that to let's say log in for

02:38.540 --> 02:42.440
him and this push button will say something like the log in.

02:43.050 --> 02:46.080
And as you can see those two they are not equally high.

02:46.230 --> 02:54.030
And if he cannot get the right size by dragging and so forth you can always check out your options here

02:54.030 --> 02:54.630
on the side.

02:54.630 --> 02:59.030
So for example for this bottom here this should be the password.

02:59.250 --> 03:05.330
And I have this geometry here which says 161 times 121.

03:05.340 --> 03:10.240
Now this one in comparison is 161 to 24.

03:10.240 --> 03:13.110
So I can make this 124 pixels high.

03:13.380 --> 03:14.720
So let me change it.

03:14.720 --> 03:20.420
You just opened it up here you can see you can always get more details and it can change to hide to

03:20.430 --> 03:21.790
let's say 24.

03:22.050 --> 03:24.210
Now they are the same size.

03:24.240 --> 03:29.550
You can have of course copy and paste them as well but generally you can see that here on the right

03:29.550 --> 03:32.620
hand side you have plenty of options that you can choose.

03:32.730 --> 03:38.640
You can choose the minimum size the base size you can change to fund even and so forth.

03:38.640 --> 03:45.480
You can get a tool tip something like password could be a good tool too for this element here if somebody

03:45.480 --> 03:51.110
hovers over this field then he will see the tool tip and so forth.

03:51.120 --> 03:57.580
So you can see plenty of good stuff and it's pretty easy to adjust it so you can very easily adjust

03:57.580 --> 03:58.920
the elements in here.

03:58.970 --> 04:05.090
You can see this cue widget has plenty of properties that you can change any time.

04:05.120 --> 04:13.170
Now we have something like a scroll area where we can put many different objects when we have too many.

04:13.170 --> 04:15.990
Then you can scroll in it.

04:15.990 --> 04:24.790
So this will allow us to scroll inside of it and I'm going to get rid of it because I want to use it.

04:24.810 --> 04:29.200
You have the tab widget which is a pretty cool one we can create multiple tabs.

04:29.280 --> 04:39.150
So let's say you have the log in form in the first tab and make this whole screen a little bigger.

04:39.150 --> 04:45.870
So I will drag this over and this is not about making this whole thing beautiful it's really just about

04:45.870 --> 04:47.970
showing you the different options that we have.

04:47.970 --> 04:54.570
So this is going to be Tab 1 and I want to change the name of Tab 1 or the text that it set dates of.

04:54.570 --> 04:58.730
Tab 1 and I can do that and.

04:58.720 --> 05:02.030
Q tab widget here to drop.

05:02.100 --> 05:10.140
Scroll down and here you will find the current tab text and the current tab text is Tab 1 and I could

05:10.140 --> 05:16.080
say something like the log in and then the second one would be something completely different something

05:16.080 --> 05:18.230
like Hello.

05:18.420 --> 05:24.660
And in this low one I just have this button which just doesn't do anything but it's there.

05:24.900 --> 05:31.500
So you can move around and you have pretty much is a behavior of multiple types so it's pretty cool.

05:31.500 --> 05:33.550
Then for example a combo box.

05:33.840 --> 05:40.320
So let's add this little combo box here and this combo box we can easily add some elements in here so

05:40.320 --> 05:45.240
let's say this combo box will contain something like mathematics.

05:46.110 --> 05:51.360
Math math takes then informatics

05:53.500 --> 05:56.690
in English.

05:57.090 --> 06:05.460
So if somebody is an English major and stuff like that and this will be biology

06:08.790 --> 06:09.470
and so forth.

06:09.540 --> 06:15.470
So now if somebody selects this combo box he can choose from those options.

06:15.990 --> 06:17.880
Then you have a line edit.

06:17.880 --> 06:23.580
We've seen that one where we can simply add one line but there is also something called a text added

06:24.360 --> 06:28.880
and something called a plain text and it's going to show you both of them.

06:28.890 --> 06:36.240
So this text added here here it can actually added text and adjusted so you can see it's up to him all

06:36.240 --> 06:40.850
that I can write in here with rich text and you can see the source code behind it.

06:40.850 --> 06:47.080
So those two email source code behind it and it can just say something like hello world and make these

06:47.160 --> 06:50.630
Hello bold and maybe in a different font size.

06:50.640 --> 06:52.770
Even so simple as that.

06:52.920 --> 06:59.160
But this plain text here this plain text and it is really just very basic text which I cannot edit.

06:59.160 --> 07:04.770
So no adding or editing here.

07:05.290 --> 07:14.070
OK then you have a very horizontal scroll bar so if somebody should be able to scroll or even a horizontal

07:14.370 --> 07:24.410
sliders you can at that where somebody can slide back and forth aunt date time so somebody should be

07:24.410 --> 07:34.270
able to edit his date and his time so they had time edit he or somebody can select the date.

07:34.280 --> 07:39.440
You have spin boxes or you can just spin around with the values double spin boxes.

07:39.440 --> 07:44.810
We also have a floating point in there that you can add labels.

07:44.810 --> 07:53.270
So for example the label here would say something like your major or your subject or something like

07:53.270 --> 07:53.600
that.

07:53.630 --> 07:56.930
Your subject.

07:56.930 --> 08:03.680
So if a student should select something here and so forth so you can see there are a bunch a bunch of

08:03.680 --> 08:06.440
different widgets and layouts that we can use.

08:06.650 --> 08:13.100
And that's very powerful because we can pretty much direct stuff in then connected to our code and pretty

08:13.100 --> 08:18.680
much use it so we could use the user input from this log in screen can use to user input from a text

08:18.680 --> 08:26.870
editor or a plain text edit or from a date selection here so somebody could select his birth date and

08:26.870 --> 08:27.660
so forth.

08:28.750 --> 08:36.970
So I'd say now it's time to check out how his user interface looks like once we pretty much created

08:36.970 --> 08:38.360
in our pie chart.

08:38.470 --> 08:43.210
So for now we just created this UI at this UI limits and we cannot interact with them.

08:43.210 --> 08:50.620
We can only drag around in the UI itself but we cannot pretty much select them and use them as if they

08:50.620 --> 08:52.760
were standard applications.

08:52.760 --> 08:57.050
So let's build it again because we need to build that file.

08:57.150 --> 08:57.450
But.

08:57.460 --> 09:03.730
You have to save it right so you have to save this file control as then you can go back to pide charm

09:04.030 --> 09:05.410
and run your bill.

09:05.470 --> 09:09.610
Why file so run this part built.

09:09.770 --> 09:12.730
And once that is done our main window.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.630
P Y will be adjusted.

09:14.630 --> 09:18.670
So now you will see there are a bunch of new lines of code.

09:18.710 --> 09:26.450
So we have added a combo box of plain text that added a text added horizontal slider all those kind

09:26.450 --> 09:28.680
of things we have added all of that in there.

09:28.850 --> 09:34.430
And now what we can do is we can run our main Y because it still contains the main window that we had

09:34.430 --> 09:35.230
created.

09:35.450 --> 09:41.160
And now if we run that's let me select main and run main.

09:41.390 --> 09:48.790
You will see I have my UI so I like this I have multiple choice here just one choice to then I'm in

09:48.840 --> 09:51.570
informatics major or my subject is informatics.

09:51.590 --> 09:59.930
I can slide stuff around here I can change the dates and here I can just play around with pretty much

09:59.930 --> 10:02.290
all of those forms So here's our tab.

10:02.420 --> 10:04.130
Log in and hello click me.

10:04.130 --> 10:05.200
Of course nothing happens.

10:05.200 --> 10:08.560
Same with log in here I can enter something.

10:08.570 --> 10:10.690
So you see it's not that difficult.

10:10.790 --> 10:14.150
It's actually quite easy and you already have all the tools to do so.

10:14.240 --> 10:16.850
Now of course you might say man I want to direct with it.

10:16.850 --> 10:23.300
I want to do something in code so for example if somebody clicks this button then I want to have a pop

10:23.300 --> 10:26.660
up or I want to see some information or something change.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.790
Well of course we're going to do that later on.

10:28.940 --> 10:34.990
But for now we are going to look at a little more into the qued creator so see in the next video.
