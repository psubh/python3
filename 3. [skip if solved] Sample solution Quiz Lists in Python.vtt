00:00.170 --> 00:05.330
We'll come back and this video we are going to look through the worst that we just had.

00:05.340 --> 00:11.370
And if you managed to answer all the questions correctly with confidence then you can simply can skip

00:11.370 --> 00:13.010
this video and go to the next one.

00:13.320 --> 00:15.110
Otherwise just follow along.

00:15.360 --> 00:15.700
All right.

00:15.700 --> 00:17.850
So let's go out with the first question.

00:17.850 --> 00:20.490
How can you define a list in Python.

00:20.490 --> 00:23.520
And as you can see there are four different answers.

00:23.520 --> 00:25.890
The first one uses curly brackets.

00:25.890 --> 00:28.730
The second one uses square brackets.

00:28.800 --> 00:33.900
The third one to use the square brackets as well but the difference here is that it separates the values

00:33.900 --> 00:36.470
with a semi-colon and the fourth.

00:36.480 --> 00:41.330
And so here or possibility is using rounded brackets.

00:41.370 --> 00:47.910
Now you might know that B is the correct answer because if you want to create a list in Python you need

00:47.910 --> 00:53.440
to use to square brackets and you need to separate the values with a comma.

00:53.700 --> 00:54.950
That's exactly what it does.

00:54.950 --> 00:56.180
Be answered us.

00:56.190 --> 00:59.120
So the correct answer here is B.

00:59.670 --> 01:03.390
Now the second question how do you access the third element.

01:03.450 --> 01:09.450
And as you can see we have a list here which is called first names and there are four first names in

01:09.480 --> 01:09.810
here.

01:09.810 --> 01:19.720
Ivanka Donald Ivanna and Baron and you can see here that we have the zero index the one index index

01:19.770 --> 01:21.450
2 and index 3.

01:21.660 --> 01:26.850
And now we want to access the third element so first Ivanka second Donald.

01:26.850 --> 01:28.440
And third will be Ivanna.

01:28.450 --> 01:29.670
And how do we get Ivanna.

01:29.820 --> 01:37.480
Well we'll get her by getting the first names at index 2 because index starts with zero.

01:37.500 --> 01:38.790
Ivanka is in zero.

01:38.790 --> 01:43.290
Donald in next one and Ivanna is index too.

01:43.440 --> 01:47.540
That's why c is the correct answer.

01:47.550 --> 01:50.040
Now let's check out the third question.

01:50.040 --> 01:53.320
How do you extend to list wars with a third element.

01:53.400 --> 01:58.950
And I hope we never do that in real life but we have this little list of force or the was the first

01:59.040 --> 02:00.940
war and the second war.

02:00.960 --> 02:06.710
And you could say World War or you could even think of other wars and then we have three answers here

02:06.730 --> 02:15.590
wars and then wars had index three is going to be three wars apply three and then wars at Penn three.

02:15.780 --> 02:18.060
So which of those is the correct answer.

02:18.060 --> 02:21.960
And actually here no question marks like that.

02:22.140 --> 02:26.640
Which of those is the correct answer and the correct answer is spend.

02:26.670 --> 02:32.090
Because in order to add an element to our list we use the append function.

02:32.280 --> 02:33.190
As you can see here.

02:33.210 --> 02:36.410
So the correct answer will be the.

02:36.600 --> 02:37.280
All right.

02:37.380 --> 02:41.760
I hope you could follow along and understand everything that's going on because we're going to work

02:41.760 --> 02:43.510
with lists quite a lot.

02:43.750 --> 02:50.550
And the next video we're going to check out how to use the pop function in order to get rid of an element

02:50.610 --> 02:53.970
in our list and specifically the last element of the list.

02:54.030 --> 02:56.570
So see you in the next video.
