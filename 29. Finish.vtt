00:01.200 --> 00:05.240
So now you have learnt Python and you have learned cute.

00:05.280 --> 00:07.140
And what's next.

00:07.140 --> 00:10.730
First of all you now know the basics of python and cute.

00:10.760 --> 00:13.350
And another hint for productive use.

00:13.350 --> 00:20.010
Please read the license of cute cute and to all the tools that you're using in order to know how you

00:20.010 --> 00:25.050
may use them and how you may not use them as long as you deliver the application in.

00:25.050 --> 00:28.520
Source Code PI firm offers this anyways right.

00:28.530 --> 00:34.950
You don't need to buy a license so you will need to buy the pike qued license which can be 500 euros

00:34.960 --> 00:42.720
or dollars to someone other then you know the basics of how to develop a real desktop application and

00:42.720 --> 00:49.470
cute so you can pretty much go ahead and drag and drop all the UI elements the widgets and the buttons

00:49.470 --> 00:56.460
into your UI and then connect them to your Python code and develop a whole Python application which

00:56.460 --> 01:02.250
is a real desktop application so that users exactly know what they need to do based on how good your

01:02.250 --> 01:03.540
UI is of course.

01:03.570 --> 01:08.910
No of course you can also use all other Python functions in this type application so you can even write

01:08.910 --> 01:14.660
that in Python only without even using cute creator but your creator is a pretty good tool.

01:14.720 --> 01:17.550
So not know how to use it as well.

01:17.550 --> 01:24.390
So the example crawler that downloads data from the Internet today and prepares it in a graphical way

01:24.780 --> 01:27.280
so you could simply do that and cute.

01:27.300 --> 01:30.270
You already know how to create a crawler.

01:30.360 --> 01:35.460
You have done that in chuckers chapter 10 I think and now you know how to use q.

01:35.460 --> 01:40.350
Now you could combined it or you could pretty much combine any application that you have developed throughout

01:40.350 --> 01:45.390
this course and create a graphical user interface with cute with it.

01:45.390 --> 01:46.730
All right so you know how to do it.

01:46.740 --> 01:48.110
You could just go ahead and do that.

01:48.120 --> 01:52.750
And that's actually a good thing to do for you just for practice.

01:52.770 --> 01:59.430
Now you can of course extend that crawler where you read the data in the background and valuated with

01:59.430 --> 02:06.780
Pendarvis and non-P and the result that is displayed by a cute so you could really say OK I am downloading

02:06.780 --> 02:14.520
the data from a website where you of course have to have the rights to do that and then you simply use

02:14.520 --> 02:19.210
non-P and pondus in order to display it in a very nice way and cute.

02:19.380 --> 02:21.450
So that sounds like a good challenge.

02:21.450 --> 02:25.860
If you want to do that feel free and if you want to share your results of course you can also share

02:25.860 --> 02:26.880
them with us.

02:27.420 --> 02:33.780
And if you would like to get on with it and learn even more about it than find a sample project and

02:33.780 --> 02:36.020
implement it with Python and cute.

02:36.060 --> 02:40.860
Just go ahead and build some projects because that's really how you learn programming and that's how

02:40.860 --> 02:43.100
you become a good programmer by repetition.

02:43.110 --> 02:51.750
By challenging yourself with new examples new projects new challenges and then maybe a C++ course might

02:51.750 --> 02:57.960
make sense especially one which covers skewed as well so if you feel like becoming a cupro and really

02:58.290 --> 03:04.980
digging deep inside and really understanding everything then it really wouldn't make sense to of course.

03:04.980 --> 03:12.540
Also take a C++ course where you understand the documentation better where you understand a lot more

03:12.540 --> 03:15.200
what's going on in the background those kind of things.

03:15.570 --> 03:21.990
So yeah that's pretty much it for this chapter and I hope you enjoyed this chapter and I hope that you

03:22.020 --> 03:24.150
now have some ideas of what to develop.

03:24.150 --> 03:27.840
And if you don't then just take the ideas of others and develop those.

03:27.840 --> 03:32.970
Just ask people for ideas and then they will always give you some ideas and you can try to build those

03:32.970 --> 03:35.360
things because you already know how to do that.

03:35.370 --> 03:38.880
And if you don't know how to do it you know how to find how to do it.

03:38.910 --> 03:44.080
So you just know that you need to find a framework that can help you to solve something.

03:44.080 --> 03:49.740
We've used many different frameworks in this course and now you know how to use those frameworks and

03:49.740 --> 03:55.350
how to use documentation's and those kind of things and you're pretty much ready for your own projects

03:55.350 --> 03:56.150
now.

03:56.570 --> 04:02.680
So I hope you go ahead and become a good Python developer if you do so please let me know.

04:02.750 --> 04:08.550
I'll let you know about the journey that you went through let me know what you have done and what kind

04:08.550 --> 04:13.670
of job you may be got and those kind of things and I wish you all the best on your journey.

04:13.740 --> 04:18.160
All the best on your way to becoming a Python developer or a developer in general.

04:18.240 --> 04:22.710
And thanks a lot for taking part in this course and in this chapter.
