00:00.260 --> 00:06.910
Homework come back and this when you were going to finalise our calculate am I to or BMI calculator.

00:07.050 --> 00:09.120
And I hope you finalize that by yourself.

00:09.120 --> 00:11.440
And if you didn't you can of course check out this video.

00:11.610 --> 00:13.830
And if you did You can skip this video.

00:13.830 --> 00:14.590
All right.

00:14.760 --> 00:17.640
So let's go ahead and start.

00:17.640 --> 00:25.900
So first of all what we need is to take the values from our height and our weight.

00:26.010 --> 00:32.870
So hungry to do that is instead of having this on button click method which I'm going to get rid of.

00:32.880 --> 00:40.950
And also all of my other code I'm going to create a new method here which should pretty much be called

00:40.950 --> 00:41.300
Code.

00:41.300 --> 00:47.690
Q late underscore BMI because that's exactly what it does.

00:47.760 --> 00:55.080
And here I'm going to create a new variable called height and that will take the element called height

00:55.260 --> 00:56.910
and will take its value.

00:56.940 --> 00:59.230
So what is this UI element called height.

00:59.280 --> 01:02.800
Let's go to cute and check this out.

01:02.820 --> 01:06.860
So this one here has the object name height.

01:06.930 --> 01:10.330
So that's the identifier of that object.

01:10.470 --> 01:11.480
If I would change that.

01:11.490 --> 01:13.700
And I would have to change to code as well.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.210
So that's pretty much this.

01:15.210 --> 01:17.880
Here where is OK in your UI.

01:17.880 --> 01:22.920
There is something called height and I want to get the value so somebody presses on the button.

01:22.920 --> 01:24.140
We get the height.

01:24.150 --> 01:26.180
Now we need to do the same with the weight.

01:26.640 --> 01:31.810
So I'm gonna say self-taught.

01:31.860 --> 01:34.700
Why weight that value.

01:34.740 --> 01:37.290
So that will give me the value of the weight.

01:37.290 --> 01:40.310
And now I want to do the calculation.

01:40.380 --> 01:50.100
So let's say I want to calculate the BMI which will be weighed divided by height and now with the high

01:50.100 --> 01:55.200
we have to be careful because it's height Square.

01:55.260 --> 02:00.940
Now if we do that and now we could go ahead and set the text.

02:00.960 --> 02:07.380
So self-taught you are that real salt that said text.

02:07.380 --> 02:11.760
And here we can said to be a mine but now of course the BMI is of type float.

02:11.760 --> 02:14.880
So we need to make a strength from it.

02:14.880 --> 02:15.660
OK.

02:15.810 --> 02:20.100
So that's pretty much already the basic functionality right.

02:20.100 --> 02:26.430
So this function will already do everything that we need to do except for that the button doesn't actually

02:26.430 --> 02:27.950
call this function yet.

02:28.080 --> 02:31.890
So we need to connect that to the bottom to the Click event of the button.

02:31.890 --> 02:32.930
To be precise.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.930
So we need to go ahead and say self-taught UI to calculate.

02:36.930 --> 02:42.210
So there is this cut to the button and I want to add this clicked.

02:42.240 --> 02:53.530
So if somebody clicks on that button I want to connect it to self thought calculate B am I.

02:53.550 --> 02:57.110
So I just want to execute this calculate BMI method.

02:57.120 --> 02:58.990
If somebody clicks on that button.

02:59.150 --> 03:01.380
So that's pretty much what I was saying here.

03:01.920 --> 03:03.170
OK now we can save.

03:03.180 --> 03:06.260
That's when we can already run it.

03:06.520 --> 03:09.700
And as you can see flow to division by zero.

03:09.910 --> 03:10.540
There we are.

03:10.540 --> 03:16.840
We already get this area where it says OK it could be zero and it is zero actually when we started it's

03:16.840 --> 03:17.920
already zero.

03:18.040 --> 03:25.090
So let's go back here we can see we are trying to divide by the height of zero.

03:25.090 --> 03:31.560
Now we could of course say we are going to set the value to something that is not zero from the start.

03:31.560 --> 03:36.200
So press on your element here this double spin box.

03:36.400 --> 03:40.370
And now we go to minimum value.

03:40.510 --> 03:44.680
So the double spin box has a property called minimum.

03:44.680 --> 03:48.700
And in here you could say OK the minimum is going to be point 1.

03:48.700 --> 03:51.810
So somebody has to be at least 1 centimeter tall.

03:52.060 --> 03:58.360
So we can save this now and go back to our build UI and execute it.

03:58.570 --> 04:02.640
Once that is done we go to our main P Y and we execute it again.

04:02.980 --> 04:06.650
And now we have this problem where we have a non type.

04:06.700 --> 04:14.730
So we're trying to access calculate BMI and actually here I'm trying to call the method here.

04:14.730 --> 04:19.930
So that's the problem and it can up can come up very quickly when you just say self-dual calculate BMI

04:19.930 --> 04:25.690
and because it's a method you already feel automatically inclined to call the method but we actually

04:25.690 --> 04:29.320
just passing the method here and we're not calling the method itself.

04:29.320 --> 04:30.450
We're just connecting it.

04:30.640 --> 04:33.640
So now let me run it again and this arrow should disappear.

04:33.910 --> 04:34.780
There we are.

04:34.780 --> 04:41.220
So now if I press calculate BMI I can see my BMI is zero point zero.

04:41.650 --> 04:52.070
Now if I enter 0 here calculate BMI as you can see I cannot set that to zero any more.

04:52.090 --> 04:59.380
OK so that's how you can already fix that problem whereas if somebody actually enter 0 then you can

04:59.380 --> 05:00.630
just change the value.

05:00.820 --> 05:05.740
But if you really want to make sure that it's never zero you can of course add an if statement here.

05:05.740 --> 05:12.390
So if height is not equal zero only then I want to do all of this calculation stuff.

05:12.460 --> 05:15.200
So only then I want to do all of this.

05:15.320 --> 05:20.510
And now of course the B.M. I could be a very weird value here.

05:20.530 --> 05:21.820
So we should round it.

05:21.880 --> 05:25.810
But we're going to do that in a second before we do that.

05:25.840 --> 05:29.160
So let's add some value.

05:29.160 --> 05:30.880
So let's actually test values.

05:31.000 --> 05:36.590
So it's had a height let's say were 2 meters high.

05:36.770 --> 05:40.940
And we have a weight of 100 kilograms.

05:41.460 --> 05:46.960
And actually you see I cannot enter weight higher than 99.

05:47.060 --> 05:50.400
So the minimum is the maximum value of this weight is 99.

05:50.630 --> 05:51.870
So let me calculate it.

05:51.890 --> 05:53.420
And it can see that's the BMI here.

05:53.420 --> 05:55.360
Twenty four point seven five.

05:55.550 --> 05:58.790
And that's because it perfectly fits with those numbers.

05:59.360 --> 06:07.080
And what if somebody is 2 meters and 13 then you suddenly see you get this very ugly value here.

06:07.100 --> 06:08.660
So that's something that we have to fix.

06:08.660 --> 06:15.240
And also the weight in kilograms should be fixed so its maximum value is 99 and we can change it.

06:15.240 --> 06:21.640
So weight in kilogramme Let's change the maximum to let's say something like 999 OK.

06:21.830 --> 06:26.620
So people could add values up to 999 for the weight.

06:27.420 --> 06:33.600
OK let's save that and rerun are built up twice so change to build.

06:33.710 --> 06:35.850
Run it and go back to Main again.

06:36.140 --> 06:36.920
OK.

06:37.370 --> 06:42.440
Now how do we solve this issue with a ugly number.

06:42.470 --> 06:44.450
Well we just say please.

06:44.450 --> 06:45.680
Round two billion.

06:45.820 --> 06:46.550
OK.

06:46.610 --> 06:47.670
And how do we rounded.

06:47.690 --> 06:51.220
Well we just want to round it to two decimal points.

06:51.310 --> 06:53.490
OK so that's what we do here.

06:53.540 --> 07:01.280
Now the next thing that we want to do is to actually display or hide the values.

07:01.300 --> 07:05.820
We don't need or the UI elements that that we don't need to be precise.

07:05.840 --> 07:10.730
So at the beginning when we start our application we don't need to.

07:11.000 --> 07:17.590
To have this value here we don't need this label we don't need to be a calculation or the result here

07:17.600 --> 07:18.770
we don't need those.

07:18.770 --> 07:22.010
So we can basically get rid of them in the constructor.

07:22.250 --> 07:28.940
So you can just say self-taught you dot result and hide it.

07:28.940 --> 07:30.740
So there's this hied method.

07:30.740 --> 07:36.830
I would just say hide and the same with the result labels self third you Piedad and then you might say

07:36.840 --> 07:41.720
OK we don't have a result level we'll just have a label 1 2 and 4 and stuff like that.

07:41.960 --> 07:50.020
OK so what we need to do is we need to find the label.

07:50.040 --> 07:52.620
It's this one here and change its name.

07:52.670 --> 07:59.310
So I'm going to change its name to resoled on those core label or actually I could also use and resoled

07:59.360 --> 08:00.550
label like that.

08:00.740 --> 08:03.100
Well how do you prefer that's how you can take it.

08:03.110 --> 08:05.210
I'm just going to say we sold the label.

08:05.560 --> 08:05.990
OK.

08:06.020 --> 08:16.970
And then let's go back here we can go ahead and say self-taught UI result label that hide.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.630
Now this code will crash and you might guess why.

08:20.810 --> 08:25.260
Because I didn't run my build the way you see has no result label.

08:25.280 --> 08:27.290
So I need to run the ball why.

08:27.680 --> 08:30.760
Once again each time I make a change in acute creator.

08:30.920 --> 08:34.960
I need to run to build why I get.

08:35.160 --> 08:39.080
And now let me check that or write it correctly.

08:39.730 --> 08:41.650
Or did I not save my file here.

08:41.670 --> 08:41.920
Yes.

08:41.950 --> 08:43.620
I didn't save it in here.

08:43.840 --> 08:45.520
So let me save it again.

08:45.760 --> 08:50.340
Run my read my Bill P. Y and then run my main again.

08:50.380 --> 08:52.030
And now suddenly the error disappears.

08:52.060 --> 08:55.550
OK so now we want to display those too.

08:55.570 --> 09:02.820
Once I calculate the BMI because otherwise I don't ever get the right information displayed.

09:02.920 --> 09:11.170
So what I'm going to say is I'm going to cut those two or copy those two and I'm just going to add them

09:11.170 --> 09:13.220
in here and instead of hiding.

09:13.240 --> 09:15.280
I'm just going to show them.

09:15.280 --> 09:19.790
So those two elements should be shown.

09:19.840 --> 09:22.370
Now what shall we this play.

09:22.480 --> 09:31.480
If somebody says or writes a wrong value so somebody just doesn't have a height of at least zero or

09:31.480 --> 09:32.650
higher than zero.

09:32.830 --> 09:44.930
Well then we could go ahead and say self thought why we sold and said text said text to please enter

09:45.020 --> 09:51.190
a weight or a height higher

09:53.980 --> 09:56.230
than zero.

09:56.490 --> 09:58.870
And now though they won't see that of course.

09:59.020 --> 10:04.780
And that is because we don't display the results label at all or the result.

10:05.170 --> 10:13.020
So what we could do is we could say enter a value higher and so on showed a result.

10:13.240 --> 10:16.510
So if we stop and run again.

10:16.590 --> 10:18.350
Now let me enter zero.

10:18.630 --> 10:22.380
Calculate BMI You should see your BMI is 0 0.

10:22.530 --> 10:25.150
That's because it never actually takes the value of 0.

10:25.350 --> 10:32.240
So we will never actually see this else but if we hadn't set the value to zero then that would be fine.

10:32.400 --> 10:40.560
The problem is that we already take the values of 0 0 and there is already something happening once

10:40.560 --> 10:42.170
we start our application.

10:42.210 --> 10:52.260
So let me deactivate the minimum value just to test for testing purposes here is the height.

10:52.290 --> 10:55.190
Let's change its minimum value to zero.

10:55.260 --> 11:00.560
Once again let's say fit and run are built again.

11:00.560 --> 11:07.630
Now run our main and we should see Please enter a height higher than zero.

11:07.630 --> 11:07.960
All right.

11:07.960 --> 11:08.870
Perfect.

11:08.890 --> 11:10.240
So that works already.

11:10.450 --> 11:17.230
And now we can enter anything you want in here.

11:17.260 --> 11:25.120
A way to Haiti calculate BMI and you see your BMI is twenty two point one six.

11:25.120 --> 11:25.760
All right.

11:25.760 --> 11:27.730
So I'd say that's pretty good.

11:27.740 --> 11:31.920
We have our own little BMI calculator with a UI.

11:31.940 --> 11:36.250
It looks damn good and it does everything that we wanted to do.

11:36.260 --> 11:38.930
I hope you could manage to solve this exercise.

11:39.020 --> 11:41.450
Maybe you had slightly different code that's totally fine.

11:41.450 --> 11:46.360
No worries as long as it does what it should do and that's calculating the BMI.

11:46.370 --> 11:50.170
And as long as it doesn't crash the application then you're good to go.

11:50.420 --> 11:50.810
OK.

11:50.840 --> 11:54.210
So I hope you enjoy this exercise and see you in the next video.
