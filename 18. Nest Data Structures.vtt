00:00.390 --> 00:03.200
Now I would like to show you that you can nest lists.

00:03.210 --> 00:05.730
So in Python it is allowed to nest lists.

00:05.820 --> 00:11.340
This allows you to model a metrics for example and this lesson you will learn how to nest lists and

00:11.610 --> 00:13.780
then access the elements accordingly.

00:13.980 --> 00:23.000
So let's create a list and let's say we have a list and in there I would like to have a list of cities

00:23.430 --> 00:29.440
and I would like to have a list of cities from the U.S. another list list of cities from Munich Hungary

00:29.610 --> 00:30.480
or stuff like that.

00:30.480 --> 00:44.100
So let's say I start off with New York then I have Chicago to go and then I have Los Angeles and so

00:44.100 --> 00:44.700
forth.

00:44.910 --> 00:48.860
So I can go ahead and create a list with lists.

00:48.900 --> 00:54.760
So this one contains a list of two list elements all New York blah blah blah.

00:54.780 --> 01:03.570
So these three are elements within list at the index zero of my list one and now index one I have another

01:03.990 --> 01:13.220
list which says Budapest then perch and so on.

01:14.010 --> 01:25.590
So if I would like to access a list element I can just say List 1 and 0 and let's see we have New York

01:25.590 --> 01:27.210
Chicago Los Angeles.

01:27.240 --> 01:30.610
But what if I want to specifically access Chicago.

01:30.900 --> 01:35.060
Well then I can simply say 0 1.

01:35.130 --> 01:37.380
So I'm accessing Chicago.

01:37.380 --> 01:44.490
So within the list at which position is Chicago well it's index position 1.

01:44.520 --> 01:49.250
So New York is in its position zero and Chicago is in the index position 1.

01:49.350 --> 01:51.210
And where is this list in total.

01:51.330 --> 01:55.570
Well it's the index position zero of my list 1.

01:55.650 --> 01:57.710
So that's how you can access it.

01:57.860 --> 02:01.410
Now we can also use lists and dictionaries.

02:01.410 --> 02:05.720
So let's go ahead and create a dictionary called students.

02:06.310 --> 02:11.210
And now in there I can store loads of information.

02:11.220 --> 02:20.220
So for example I can go ahead and say something like informatics is connected to all the students who

02:20.220 --> 02:30.840
study this subject so I'm going to have a list where I have Max and Monica as you can see there is another

02:31.410 --> 02:35.100
topic which should be history for example.

02:35.100 --> 02:42.520
And there I have the students Eric and Paula.

02:44.400 --> 02:44.750
All right.

02:44.760 --> 02:55.200
So that's what you generally also can do so you can use lists as the value of a dictionary but you cannot

02:55.200 --> 02:57.360
use that as the key of a dictionary.

02:57.370 --> 03:02.320
So the key of a dictionary has to be an immutable type.

03:02.370 --> 03:13.110
All right so let's print those out let's print the students who study informatics and here have to be

03:13.110 --> 03:19.420
careful that I write a comment correctly or informatics because otherwise I get an error.

03:19.470 --> 03:29.530
As you know and here Max and Monica and now I'm going to print to students who study history history.

03:29.670 --> 03:33.290
And let's run it them we see Eric and Paula.

03:33.330 --> 03:39.090
So that's just something that I also wanted to show you when it comes to nesting lists.
