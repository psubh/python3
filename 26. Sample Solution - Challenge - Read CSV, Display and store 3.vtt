00:00.600 --> 00:06.600
Already in the last week we managed to read the file in order to display the data.

00:06.780 --> 00:12.390
And as you can see making changes to mathematics or mathematics here doesn't really help.

00:12.390 --> 00:17.760
So from the last video each time I restart the program I get mathematics here because that's what I

00:17.760 --> 00:22.310
had stored in my cute editor.

00:22.530 --> 00:27.720
But what we're going to add in this video is the new entry functionality so this button should get some

00:27.720 --> 00:34.730
functionality so that we get a new entry here at the bottom where we then actually can enter a new value.

00:34.740 --> 00:39.780
So a new student of course it will not be stored won't be saved yet but that's something that we will

00:40.080 --> 00:41.650
look at in the next video.

00:41.760 --> 00:46.720
But for now let's just add this new entry button functionality in order to do so.

00:46.770 --> 00:53.640
It really makes sense to start by creating a new method for that so I'm going to say new or new entry.

00:54.390 --> 01:02.300
And what I want to write in here is actually I want to first of all create a new row.

01:02.640 --> 01:08.280
And in order to do so I need to know how many rows to work so I can pretty much use the same functionality

01:08.280 --> 01:13.500
that we had here where we said OK give me the row count and I'm going to save it or stored in this variable

01:13.500 --> 01:15.090
called row count.

01:15.090 --> 01:21.760
Now the next thing I can do here is I can insert a row or using the insert row functionality that we

01:21.760 --> 01:27.730
have used here as well so I can pretty much use the same functionality you can just copy and paste it

01:28.110 --> 01:30.960
as you can see we'll just create a new row for me.

01:31.410 --> 01:38.430
And now I need to connect that button functionality in my constructor here.

01:38.490 --> 01:44.710
So I need to say self-taught UI new entry button.

01:44.790 --> 01:46.800
So the Watts's button called new entry button.

01:46.950 --> 01:52.090
And if we check our cute editor we will see that this is the new entry button.

01:52.320 --> 01:59.400
While we're here I'm gonna save myrth more ticks in here.

01:59.670 --> 02:05.330
So let me save it and let me rerun the build real quick.

02:06.150 --> 02:07.260
OK.

02:08.280 --> 02:12.890
So this new entry button I want to connect it.

02:13.140 --> 02:14.300
And how do we do that.

02:14.310 --> 02:21.960
Well we said I want to connect the clicked event to a specific method.

02:22.020 --> 02:29.070
So to the method called on new entry and here we don't want to call the method but we just want to pass

02:29.070 --> 02:32.070
the method as a well as a whole method.

02:32.070 --> 02:34.390
So the name not the actual call.

02:34.620 --> 02:40.830
OK so now we have this click event we connected to it and now we should be able to create new entries.

02:40.830 --> 02:47.700
So let's run this and new entry and if we make this a little bigger you can see that it creates new

02:47.700 --> 02:49.050
entries for me.

02:49.050 --> 02:50.870
Now I can already click into it.

02:50.880 --> 02:54.200
I can make some changes but they will be empty.

02:54.210 --> 02:56.290
So this will be empty empty empty.

02:56.460 --> 03:02.040
But what I want to have in there is an empty string because they are pretty much empty.

03:02.070 --> 03:06.000
And I can fill them with empty strings and I can even set the focus to it.

03:06.000 --> 03:14.340
So let's say I start this app and I create a new entry I want to set the focus directly onto this row

03:14.340 --> 03:20.050
here onto the cell to be precise and I want to be able to enter something there straight away.

03:20.100 --> 03:21.220
How do I do that.

03:21.360 --> 03:22.670
Well let's check it out.

03:22.680 --> 03:32.990
First of all we want to set items elements to an empty string and we do that by using self-actualize

03:33.030 --> 03:34.620
Students table.

03:34.860 --> 03:36.740
And we set an item.

03:36.780 --> 03:39.300
Now we need to say at which row we want to do that.

03:39.300 --> 03:43.950
And I would like to do that at row count and add the column 0.

03:43.950 --> 03:52.830
I would like to add a value called or qued widgets that qued table items that you can see here qued

03:53.400 --> 03:56.650
table or queue table widget item.

03:56.730 --> 03:59.950
So queue table widget item that's the one I need.

04:00.150 --> 04:05.610
And in here I can just enter a string for example which I'm just going to say OK it's going to be an

04:05.610 --> 04:06.290
empty string.

04:06.300 --> 04:08.120
So I leave it like this.

04:08.200 --> 04:14.760
Now I'm going to do the same thing with two more rows because I need to do that with column one and

04:14.760 --> 04:15.870
column two.

04:15.900 --> 04:17.930
So I just copied and pasted the code.

04:18.030 --> 04:24.960
And now each time I do that let's see what the changes are be creating new entry and the thing is you

04:24.960 --> 04:31.320
don't see any changes but it already will have created an empty string in here which is more than it

04:31.320 --> 04:32.310
was before.

04:32.790 --> 04:40.620
And now what I want to do is I want to actually focus on a particular cell and I want to added an item

04:40.620 --> 04:53.590
straight away because if I for example directy want to added this particular cell here this one so so

04:53.830 --> 04:55.520
it should focus on this one.

04:55.630 --> 04:56.530
And how do we do that.

04:56.530 --> 04:59.000
Well there is something called added item.

04:59.030 --> 05:05.920
There's a method called added item which we pretty much want to call and in order to do so we need to

05:05.920 --> 05:07.360
create a cell variable.

05:07.400 --> 05:09.580
So going to show you in a second.

05:09.640 --> 05:14.300
First let's create this added item or call this added item you see self.

05:14.410 --> 05:22.810
And it requires an item and now that item that cries of type q table widget item so the same type that

05:22.810 --> 05:24.000
we had here.

05:24.280 --> 05:30.910
So what we can do now is we can simply say OK this cell that we're looking at should be self taught

05:30.910 --> 05:40.900
you find students table at the row that we're currently looking at and call them zero.

05:41.700 --> 05:47.690
So I can just pass this sell here and I can save it and run it again.

05:48.580 --> 05:50.030
Now you will see something.

05:50.030 --> 05:56.520
So that means creating your entry as you can see now the cursor straight away in sight of this cell

05:56.860 --> 05:58.210
and why is that.

05:58.370 --> 06:05.120
Because we created those two lines and 25 and 26 which say OK I created you cell and the cell should

06:05.120 --> 06:08.090
be the row count.

06:08.150 --> 06:13.730
So pretty much the cell that we've just created by pressing your entry as you can see rockhound is the

06:13.730 --> 06:16.420
amount of rows that we had.

06:16.580 --> 06:24.490
So if we had 10 rows for example and now we create an eleventh one it will have the index of 10.

06:24.560 --> 06:27.830
So it's pretty much just new Roder we have just created.

06:27.830 --> 06:29.480
So it's going to be this one.

06:29.750 --> 06:36.520
And now I say OK please added this item called cell and this item called cell.

06:36.520 --> 06:40.780
Is this item here which is in row count pretty much.

06:40.820 --> 06:50.140
In this case 0 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 so it's at rockhound 6 and in column 0 we have defined here.

06:50.540 --> 06:50.890
OK.

06:50.900 --> 06:53.120
So row count and zero.

06:53.180 --> 06:56.300
So just says OK I'm going to edit this item sell.

06:56.330 --> 06:57.770
So that's pretty cool.

06:57.860 --> 07:03.830
And that's already very convenient because now we can create a new entry and we can directly enter something

07:03.830 --> 07:05.030
in here.

07:05.120 --> 07:08.150
And so that's how easy it is to do that.

07:09.230 --> 07:11.710
OK now we don't have the save button yet.

07:11.720 --> 07:13.540
We don't store any changes.

07:13.550 --> 07:21.320
If my press save and I close the application I start the application once again you can see that the

07:21.320 --> 07:24.100
new entry is not there.

07:24.650 --> 07:28.530
So that's something that we're going to look at in the next video.

07:28.550 --> 07:29.690
So see you there.
